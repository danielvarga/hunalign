1 . 1 chapter I
1 . 1 . 1 I
all afternoon the wind sift out of the black Welsh glen , crying notice that winter be come sliding down over the world from the Pole ; and riverward there be the faint moan of new ice .
It be a sad day , a day of grey unrest , of discontent .
the gently moving air seem to be celebrate the loss of some gay thing with a soft , tender elegy .
but in the pasture great work horse nervously stamp they foot , and all through the country small brown bird , in clique of four or five , fly twitter from tree to tree and back again , seek and calling in recruit for they southing .
A few goat clamber to the tops of high lone rock and long stare upward with they yellow eyes and sniff the heaven .
<p>
the afternoon pass slowly , procession-like with an end of evening , and on the heel of the evening an excited wind rush out , rustle in the dry grass , and flee whimpering across the field .
night draw down like a black cowl , and holy winter send he nuncio to Wales .
<p>
beside the high-road which line the valley , run up through a cleft in the hill , and so out into the world , there stand an ancient farmhouse build of heavy stone and thatch .
the Morgan who have build it play against time and nearly win .
<p>
inside the house a fire be burning on the hearth ; an iron kettle hang over the blaze , and a black iron oven hide in the coal which fell about the edge of the flame .
the brisk firelight glint on the tip of long-handled pike in rack upon the wall , weapon unused in the hundred year since Morgan clamour in Glendowers' rank and tremble with rage at the flinty lines of Iolo Goch .
<p>
the wide brass binding of a great chest , which stand in a corner , suck in the light and glow resp1endently .
paper there be in the chest , and parchment , and stiff untanned skin , write in English and Latin and the old Cumric tongue : Morgan be born , Morgan be married , Morgan become a knight , Morgan be hang .
here lay the history of the house , shameful and glorious .
but the family be few now , and little enough likely to add record to the chest other than the simple chronicle : Morgan be born-and die .
<p>
there be Old Robert , for instance , sitting in he high-backed chair , sitting and smile into the fire .
he smile be perplexity and a strange , passive defiance .
you would have say he seek to make that fate which be responsible for he be , a little ashamed of she by smile at it .
often he wearily considered he existence , ringed around with little defeat which mock it as street child torment a cripple .
It be strange to Old Robert that he , who know so much more than he neighbour , who have ponder so endlessly , should be not even a good farmer .
sometimes he imagine he understand too many thing ever to do anything well .
<p>
And so Old Robert sip the burned ale of he own experiment and smile into the fire .
he wife would be whisper excuse for he , he know , and the labourer in the field removed they hat to Morgan , not to Robert .
<p>
even he aged mother , Gwenliana , here beside he , shiver to the fire as though the very wind sound about the house call in the cold to she , be not so judge incompetent .
in the cottage there be a little fear of she and a great respect .
any day when she sit in the garden holding she necromantic court , you might see some farm lad blush and hug he hat across he chest while he listen to Gwenliana's magic .
for many year , now , she have be practice the second sight and taking pride in it .
And though the family know she prophecy to be whole guess who shrewdness grow less sharp with she year , they listen to she with respect , and simulated awe , and ask of she the location of lose thing .
when , after one of she mystic recitation , the scissors be not discover under the second board of the shed floor , they pretend to find them there anyway , for , have she lose the robe of augury , there would have remain only a little wrinkle old woman soon to die .
<p>
this play of claque to a simpleton be a harsh tax on the conviction of mother Morgan .
It outrage she nature , for she be one who have , apparently , come into the world to be a scourge to all foolishness .
such matter as have so obviously no connection either with the church or with the price of thing be plainly nonsense .
<p>
Old Robert have love he wife so well and so long that he could think sharp thing about she , and the thought could not injure he affection .
when she have come home this afternoon , rage over the price of a pair of shoe she hadn't want anyway , he have considered : " she life be like a book crowded with mighty event .
every day she rise to the peak of some tremendous climax which have to do with buttons or a neighbour wedding .
I think that when true tragedy come in upon she , she will not see it over she range of ant-hill .
perhaps this be luck , " he think , and then " I wonder , now , how she would compare the kingbolt own death with the loss of one of the sow red pig . "
<p>
mother Morgan be too busy with the day she to be bother with the foolishness of abstraction .
some one in the family have to be practical or the thatch would blow away-and what could you expect of a pack of dreamer like Robert and Gwenliana and she son Henry ?
she love she husband with a queer mixture of pity and contempt born of he failing and he goodness .
<p>
young Henry , she son , she worship , though of course she could not trust he to have the least idea of what be to he benefit or conducive to he health .
And all of the family love mother Morgan and fear she and get in she way .
<p>
she have feed them and trim the lamp .
breakfast be on the fire .
now she search about for something to mend , as though she do not mend everything the moment it be tear .
in the midst of she search for busyness she pause and glance sharply at young Henry .
It be the kind of harsh , affectionate look which say , " I wonder , now , if he be not in the way of catching cold there on the floor . "
And Henry squirm , wonder what thing he have neglect to do that afternoon .
but immediately she catch up a cloth and go to dust , and the boy be reassure .
<p>
he lay prop on one elbow and stare past the fire into he thought .
the long grey afternoon , piercing to this mysterious night , have call up strong yearning in he , the seed of which be plant month before .
It be a desire for a thing he could not name .
perhaps the same force move he which collected the bird into explore party and make the animal nervously sniff upwind for the scent of winter .
<p>
young Henry be conscious , this night , that he have live on for fifteen tedious year without accomplish any single thing of importance .
And have he mother known he feeling , she would have say , " he be grow . "
<p>
And he father would have repeated after she , " yes , the boy be grow . "
but neither would have understand what the other mean .
<p>
Henry , if you considered he face , draw from he parent almost equally .
he cheek bone be high and hard , he chin firm , he upper lip short and thin like he mother .
but there , too , be the sensual underlip , and the fine nose , and the eyes which look out on dream ; these be Old Robert feature , and he be the thick , wiry hair coil like black spring against the head .
but though there be complete indecision in Robert face , there be a great quantity of decision in Henry if only he could find something about which to decide .
here be three before the fire , Robert and Gwenliana and young Henry , who eyes look out beyond the wall and saw unbodied thing-look into the night for the ghost .
<p>
It be a preternatural night ; a time when you might meet corpse-candle glide along the road , or come upon the ghost of a Roman legion march at double quick to reach it shelter city of Caerleon before the full storm break .
And the little misshapen being of the hill would be searching out desert badger hole to cover them from the night .
the wind would go crying after them through the field .
<p>
in the house it be quiet except for the snap fire-noise and for the swish sound of blow thatch .
A log cracked on the hearth and out of the crevice a thin blaze leap up and curl about the black kettle like a flower of flame .
now mother flurry to the fireplace .
<p>
 " Robert , you will never be pay attention to the fire .
you should be poke at it now and again . "
<p>
such be she method .
she poke a large fire to make it small , and , when it die , she stir the ember violently to restore the flame .
<p>
A faint sound of footstep came along the high-road a sound that might have be the wind or those walking thing which can be see .
the step grow loud , then stopped in front of the door from whence came a timid knock .
<p>
 " come ! Robert call .
the door open softly , and there , light against the black night , stand a bent , feeble man with eyes like weak flame .
he pause on the threshold as though undecided , but in a moment advanced into the room , ask in a strange , creak voice , " Will you be knowing I , I wonder , Robert Morgan ?
Will you be knowing I that have be out so long ? "
he word be a plea .
<p>
Robert search the shrink face .
<p>
 " know you ? " he say .
 " I do not think-wait ! -can it be Dafydd ? we little farm lad Dafydd that go away to sea year past ? "
<p>
A look of complete relief came into the face of the wayfarer .
he might have be apply some delicate , fearful test to Robert Morgan .
now he chuckle .
<p>
 " It's Dafydd , sure , and rich-and cold . "
he finished with a wistfulness like a recur pain .
<p>
Dafydd be grey-white and toughen like a dry hide .
the skin of he face be stiff and thick so that he seem to change expression with slow , conscious effort .
<p>
 " I'm cold , Robert , " he queer , dry voice go on .
 " I can seem ever to get warm again .
but anyway I'm rich , " -as though he hope these two might balance " rich along with he they call Pierre le grand . "
<p>
young Henry have rise , and now he cry : " where have you be to , man-where ? "
<p>
 " where ?
why , I've be out to the Indies , that's where I've be ; to Goaves and to Tortuga the turtle-and to Jamaica and the thick woods of Hispaniola for the hunting of cattle .
I've be all there . "
<p>
 " You'll be sitting down , Dafydd , " mother Morgan interrupted .
she spoke as though he have never be away .
 " I'll about get something warm to drink .
Will you look how Henry gobble you with he eyes , Dafydd ?
like as not he'll be wanting to go to the Indies , too . "
to she , the word be a pleasant idiocy .
<p>
Dafydd keep silence , though he appear to be straining back at a desire to talk .
mother Morgan frighten he as she have when he be a towheaded farm boy .
Old Robert know he embarrassment , and mother , too , seem to sense it , for when she have put a steam cup in he hands she left the room .
<p>
wrinkle old Gwenliana be in she seat before the fire , she mind lose in the swim future .
she cloud eyes be veiled with tomorrow .
behind they vague blue surface seem to crowd the mounting event and circumstance of the world .
she be go out of the room-go into pure time , and that the future .
<p>
Old Robert watch the door close behind he wife , then settle she with turning as a dog settle .
<p>
 " now , Dafydd , " he say , and peer smile into the fire , while Henry , kneel on the floor , gaze with awe at this mortal who hold the very distance in he palm .
<p>
 " well , Robert about the green jungle I want to tell and the brown Indian that live in it , and about he they call Pierre le grand .
but , Robert , there's something go out of I like a little wink light .
I used to lie on the deck of ship at night and think and think how I'd talk arid boast when only I came home again-but it's more like a child , I be , come home to cry .
Can you understand that , Robert ?
Can you understand that at all ? "
he be leaning forward eagerly .
<p>
 " I'll tell you .
we take the tall plate ship they call a galleon , and we with only pistol and the long knife they have for cutting trail in the jungle .
Twenty-four of we there be-only twenty-four and ragged-but , Robert , we do horrid thing with those same long knife .
It's no good for a man that be a farm lad to be doing such thing and then thinking about them .
there be a fine captain-and we hang he up by he thumb before we kill he .
I do know why we do it ; I help and I do know why .
some say he be a damned papist , but then , so be Pierre le grand , I think .
<p>
 " some we pushed into the sea with they breast plate shine and shimmer as they go down-grand Spanish soldier and bubble coming out of they mouth .
you can see deep into the water there . "
Dafydd cease and look at the floor .
<p>
 " you see , I do want to be hurt you with these thing , Robert , but it's like something alive hide in I chest under I rib , and it's biting and scratch to get out of I .
I'm rich of the venture sure , but most time that do seem enough , I'm rich , maybe , than you own brother , sir Edward . "
<p>
Robert be smile with tighten lip .
now and then he eyes wander to the boy where he kneel on the hearth . .
Henry be taut with attention , gluttonously feed on the word .
when Robert spoke , he avoid Dafydd's eyes .
<p>
 " you soul burden you , " he say .
 " You'd good have a talk with the curate the morning-but about what I do know . "
<p>
 " No , no ; It's not I soul at all , " Dafydd go on quickly .
 " that soul leak out of a man the very first thing in the Indies , and leave he with a dry , shrink feeling where it be .
It's not I soul at all ; it's the poison that's in I , in I blood and in I brain .
Robert , it's shrivel I like an old orange .
the crawl thing there and the litt1e flying beast that come to you fire of nights , and the great pale flower , all poisonous .
they do horrible thing to a man .
I blood be like cold needle sliding in I vein the moment , and the fine fire before I .
all this-all-be because of the dank breathing of the jungle .
you can sleep in it nor lie in it , nor live in it at all but it breathe on you and withers you .
<p>
 " And the brown Indian-why , look ! "
he roll back he sleeve , and Robert in disgust motion he to cover the sick white horror which fester on he arm .
<p>
 " It be only a little scratch of an arrow-you could hardly see it ; but it'll be killing I before year , I guess .
There's other thing in I , Robert .
even the humans be poisonous , and a song the sailor sing about that . "
<p>
now young Henry start up excitedly .
<p>
 " but the Indian , " he cry ; " those Indian and they arrows .
tell I about them !
do they fight much ?
how do they look ? "
<p>
 " fight ? " say Dafydd .
 " yes , they fight always ; fight for a love that's in it .
when they do not be fight the man of Spain , they're at killing amongst she .
lithe as snake they be , and quick and quiet and brown as ferret ; the very devil for get out of sight before a man might get a shot at them .
<p>
 " but they're a brave , strong people with the fear in them for only two thing-dog and slavery . "
Dafydd be immersed in he tale .
 " why , boy , can you think what they would be doing to a man that might get she take in a skirmish ?
they stick he full of long jungle thorn from he head to he toe , and on the thick end of every thorn a ball of fluff like wool .
then the poor captive man stand in a circle of naked savage while they set light to the fluff .
And that Indian that do not be sing while he burn there like a torch , be cursed and call a coward .
now , can you imagine any white man doing that ?
<p>
 " but dog they fear , because the Spaniard hunt them with huge mastiff when they're at slave gathering for the mine ; and slavery be horrible to them .
to go chain body to body into the wet earth , year on the crown of year , until they die of the damp ague-rather would they be sing under the burning thorn , and dye in a flame . "
<p>
he pause and stretch he thin hands into the fireplace until they be nearly touching the blaze .
the light which have come into he eyes as he talk die out again .
<p>
 " oh , I'm tire , Robert-so very tire , " he sigh , " but there's one thing I want to tell you before I sleep .
maybe the telling will ease I , and maybe I can speak it out and then forget about it for the one night .
I musth go back to the damned place .
I can never stay away from the jungle any more , because it hot breath be on I .
here , where I be born , I shiver and freeze .
A month would find I dead .
this valley where I play and grow and worked have cast I out for a foul , hot thing .
It clean she of I with the cold .
<p>
 " now will you be give I a place to sleep , with thick cover to keep I poor blood moving ; and in the morning I'll be off again . "
he stopped and he face flex with pain .
 " I used to love the winter so . "
<p>
Old Robert help he from the room with a hand under he arm , then came and sit again by the fire .
he look at the boy who lay unmoving on the floor .
<p>
 " what be you thinking about now , son ? " he ask very softly after a time .
And Henry draw he gaze back from the land beyond the blaze .
<p>
 " I'm thinking I'll be wanting to go soon , father . "
<p>
 " I know , Henry .
the whole of this long year I've see it grow in you like a strong tree-London or Guinea or Jamaica .
It come of be fifteen and strong with the passion for new thing on you .
once I saw the valley grow small and small , too , until finally it smother I a little , I think .
but be you afraid of the knife , son , and the poison , and the Indian ?
do not these thing put fear on you ? "
<p>
 " No-o-o , " Henry say slowly .
<p>
 " of course not-and how could they ?
the word have no meaning to you at all .
but the sadness of Dafydd , and the hurt of he , and he poor , sick body be you afraid of those ?
do you want to go about the world weigh down with such a heart ? "
<p>
young Henry considered long .
<p>
 " I would not be like that , " he say at last .
 " I would be coming back very often for I blood sake . "
<p>
he father go on smile valiantly .
<p>
 " when will you be off , Henry ?
It will be lonely here without you . "
<p>
 " why , I'll go , now , as soon as I may , " say Henry ; and it seem that he be the old and Robert a little boy .
<p>
 " Henry , will you do two thing for I before you go ?
Will you be thinking tonight of the long sleeplessness I'll have because of you , and of how lose I days will be .
And will you remember the hours you mother will fret about you underclothing and the state of you religion .
That's the first thing , Henry ; but second , will you go up to old merlin on the crag-top tomorrow and tell he of you going and listen to he word ?
he be wise than you or I may ever be .
there be a kind of magic he practice which may be a help to you .
Will you do these two thing , son ? "
<p>
Henry have become very sad .
<p>
 " I would like to stay , I father , but you know "
 " yes , boy . "
Robert nod .
 " It be I sorrow that I do know .
I can be angry nor forbid you going , because I understand .
I wish I might prevent it and whip you , thinking that I help you .
but go to bed , Henry , and think and think when the light be out and the dark in around you . "
<p>
Old Robert sit dream in he chair after the boy have go .
<p>
 " why do man like I want son ? " he wonder .
 " It musth be because they hope in they poor beat soul that these new man , who be they blood , will do the thing they be not strong enough nor wise enough nor brave enough to do .
It be rather like another chance with life ; like a new bag of coin at a table of luck after you fortune be go .
perhaps the boy be doing what I might have done have I be brave enough year past .
yes , the valley have smother I , I think , and I be glad this boy of mine find it in he power to vault the mountain and stride about the world .
but it will be-so very lonely here without he . "
<p>
II
Old Robert came in from he rose garden late the next morning and stand in the room where he wife be sweeping .
she eyed the good soil on he hands with disapproval .
<p>
 " He'll be wanting to go now , mother , " Robert say nervously .
<p>
 " who will be wanting to go , and where ? "
she be brusque and busy with she sweeping ; the quick , inquisitive broom hound dust from the corner and floor crack and drive it in little puff to the open .
<p>
 " why , Henry .
He'll be wanting to go to the Indies now . "
<p>
she stopped she work to stare at he .
 " the Indies !
but , Robert !
oh , nonsense ! " she finished , and the broom swing more rapidly in she hands .
<p>
 " I've see it for long and long grow in he , " Robert go on .
 " then Dafydd came with he tales .
Henry tell I last night that he musth go . "
<p>
 " He's only a little boy , " mother Morgan snap .
 " he can be going to the Indies . "
<p>
 " when Dafydd set out , a little time ago , there be a longing in the child eyes that will never be satisfy at all , not even if he do go to the Indies .
have you notice , mother , how he eyes look away beyond the mountain at something he want ? "
<p>
 " but he may not go !
he may not ! "
<p>
 " ah , there be no use in it , mother .
A great gulf lie between I son and I , but none at all between I and I son .
if I do not know the lean hunger of he so well I might forbid he venture , and he would run away with anger in he heart for he can understand the hunger that's in I for he stay .
It would come to the same thing , anyway . "
Robert gather conviction .
<p>
 " There's a cruel difference between I son and I .
I've see it in the year of he grow .
for whereas he run about stick he finger into pot after pot of cold porridge , grandly confident that each one will prove the pottage of he dream , I may not open any kettle , for I believe all porridge to be cold .
And so-I imagine great dish of purple porridge , drench with dragon milk , sugared with a sweetness only to be envision .
he test he dream mother , and I-God help I ! -am afraid to . "
<p>
she be becoming impatient with he talk .
<p>
 " Robert , " she cry almost angrily , " in any time where there's bode on we , or need , or sorrow , you hide in word .
here be a duty to you !
this boy be too young .
there be horrible place across the sea , and the winter come in at we .
he would be sure to find he death in a cough that came to he from the winter .
you know how the dampness on he foot set he sick .
he musth not leave this farm not even to London , I say-if these eyes you talk about starve in he head .
<p>
 " how could you possibly know what kind of people he would be taking up with , and they telling he nonsense and wickedness .
I know the evil that's in the world .
do the curate mention it nearly every Sabbath and snare he call them , do you see ?
And so they be , too .
And here you stand , content to talk foolishness about purple porridge when you should be doing something or other .
you musth forbid it . "
<p>
but Robert answer she impatiently .
<p>
 " to you he be only a little boy who musth be make to say he prayer of nights and to wear a coat into the field
you have not feel the polished steel of he as I have .
yes , to you that quick , hard set of he chin be only the passing stubbornness of a headstrong child .
but I do know ; and I say to you , without pleasure , that this son of ours will be a great man , because-well-because he be not very intelligent .
he can see only one desire at a time .
I say he test he dream ; he will murder every dream with the implacable arrows of he will .
this boy will win to every goal of he aim ; for he can realize no think , no reason , but he own .
And I be sorry for he coming greatness because of a thing merlin once spoke of .
you musth look at the granite jaws of he , mother , and the trick he have of making he cheek muscle stand out with clench them . "
<p>
 " he musth not go , " she say firmly , and pinch she lip tightly together .
<p>
 " you see , mother , " Robert go on , " you be something like Henry she , for you never admit the existence of any idea save you own .
but I will not forbid he going , because I musth not have he steal out into the lonely dark with bread and cheese under he coat and a hurt feeling of injustice in he heart .
I permit he to go .
more , I help he to go if he wish it .
And then , if I have misjudge I son , he will come sneaking back with the fearful hope that no one may mention he cowardice . "
<p>
mother Morgan say , " nonsense ! " and go back to she work .
she would dissolve this thing by disbelieve it .
oh , the thousand thing she chain to limbo with she incredulity !
for many year she have beat Robert wild thought with a heavy phalanx of common sense ; she troop simply charge in and overwhelm he .
always he retire wearily and sit smile for a time .
he be sure to come back to sanity in this case as in other .
<p>
Robert be working the soil about the root of a rose bush with he strong brown hands .
he finger lift the black loam and then pat it gently back into place .
now and again he stroke the grey trunk of the bush with the touch of great love .
It be as though he smooth the cover over one about to sleep and touched it arm to be reassure of it safety .
<p>
the day be light , for winter have inched back a bit and return it hostage to the world-a small , cold sun .
young Henry came and stand near an elm by the wall , a tree draggle and leafless and gaunt with nurse the wind .
<p>
 " you have be thinking as I ask you ? " Robert spoke quietly .
<p>
Henry start .
he do not know that the man , kneel as though in adoration of the earth , have notice he ; and yet he have come here to be notice .
<p>
 " yes , father , " he say .
 " how could I help be thinking ? "
<p>
 " And have it bound you here ?
Will you be stay ? "
<p>
 " No , father I may not stay . "
he have be make sad with he father sadness .
he feel mean and shoddy to be the cause of it , but the hunger to be going still gnaw in he heart .
<p>
 " Will you be walking up to speak with merlin on the Crag-top , then ? " Robert plead .
 " Will you listen to he word with great care ? "
<p>
 " I shall go now . "
<p>
 " but , Henry , the day be half done with , and the track be long .
be wait until the morrow . "
<p>
 " I musth be away the morrow , father . "
<p>
Old Robert hands slip away slowly to the ground and lay , half-open , on the black soil at the root of the rose bush .
<p>
1 . 1 . 2 III
young Henry turn soon from the road to climb up a broad trail which soar to Crag-top and then over the wild mountain .
it winding could be see from below until it disappear into the great deft .
And on the topmost point of the trail dwell merlin ; merlin who the farm boy might have jeer at and stoned on he infrequent journey down the path have they believe he harmless .
but merlin be one who collected about she a swarm of little legend .
It be establish that the Tylwyth teg obey he and carry he message through the air on soundless wing .
child whisper of he acquaintance with certain mottle weasel which might carry on he vengeance have he need of such .
then , too , he keep a red-eared dog .
these be terrific thing , and merlin one not to be trifle with by child who do not know all the sign for protect she .
<p>
once merlin have be a fine poet , the old people say , and might have be a great .
they would softly sing " the sorrow of Plaith " or " the spear song , " to prove it .
several time he have take the chief prise of the eisteddfod , and would have be choose first bard if an aspirant of the house of Rhys have not enter against he .
then , without known cause , and merlin a young man , too , he have shut up he song in the stone house on Crag top and keep it a strict prisoner there while he grow old and old-and those who have sing he song forget them , or die .
<p>
the Crag-top house be round like a low grey tower with window let sight on the valley and on the mountain .
some say that it be build by a beleaguer giant , century ago , to keep he virgin hide while they be in that state ; and other , that kingbolt Harold have flee there after Hastings to live out he life ever watch and peer , with he one eye , down the valley and over the mountain for the coming of Norman .
<p>
merlin be old now ; he hair and long , straight beard be white and soft as spring cloud .
there be much about he of an ancient Druid priest with clear , far-seeing eyes which watch the star .
<p>
the pathway narrow on young Henry as he climb .
<p>
it inward side be a stone wall cutting into the heaven knife-like , and the misshapen , vague image along the way make it seem the rock temple of some old , crude god who worshipers be ape .
<p>
there have be grass at first , and bush , and a few brave , twist tree ; but upward all living thing die of the rock loneliness .
far below , the farmhouse huddle like feed bug and the valley shrink and draw into she .
<p>
now a mountain closed in on the other side of the trail , leave only a broad chasm to the sky .
A fierce , steady wind pour out of the blue heaven and shrill toward the valley .
upward , the strew rock be large and more black and dreadful-crouch guardian thing of the path .
<p>
Henry climb tirelessly on .
what could old merlin have to tell he , or , perhaps , to give he ?
A lotion to make he skin tough and proof against arrows ?
some charm ?
word to protect he from the devil many little servant ?
but merlin be to talk and he to listen ; and what merlin say might cure young Henry of he yearning , might keep he here in Cambria for always .
that could not be , for there be outland force , nameless foreign ghost , calling to he and beckon from across the mysterious sea .
<p>
there be no desire in he for a state or a condition , no picture in he mind of the thing to be when he have follow he longing ; but only a burning and a will overpowering to journey outward and outward after the earliest rise star .
<p>
the path break on a top of solid stone , semispherical like the crown of a hat ; and on the peak of it rise be the low , round house of merlin , all fitted of irregular rough rock , and a conical roof on it like a candle snuffer .
<p>
the old man meet he at the door before he could knock .
<p>
 " I'm young Henry Morgan , sir , and I'm going outward from here to the Indies . "
<p>
 " indeed , and be you ?
Will you come in and talk to I about it ? "
the voice be clear and low and lovely as a young wind croon in a spring-time orchard .
there be the music of sing in it , the quiet sing of a man working with tool ; and underneath , half-hear or completely imagine , there ring the seeming of harp string lightly touched and left to thrill .
<p>
the single room be thick carpet in black , and on the wall be hang harp and spear-head , harp and spear-head all the way around ; small Welsh harp and the great bronze leaf spear of the Briton , and these against the unfinished stone .
below these be the all-seeing window wherefrom you might look out on three valley and a mighty family of mountain ; and lower still , a single bench circle around the room against the wall .
there be a table in the center loaded with tatter book , and beside it a copper brazier , set on a Greek tripod of black iron .
<p>
the great hound nuzzle Henry as he enter so that he draw away in fright , for be there anything under the blue cup so deadly as the merest notice of a red-eared dog ?
<p>
 " you be going to the Indies .
sit here , boy .
see !
you can watch you home valley now , so that it go not flying off Avalon . "
the harp catch up he tone and hem an answer faint resonance .
<p>
 " I father say I be to come here and tell you of I going and listen to you speech .
I father think you speech may keep I here . "
<p>
 " going to the Indies , " merlin repeated .
 " Will you be seeing Elizabeth before you go and making grand promise to flutter the heart of she and strangle the breath in she , after you're go , from thinking of the thing you will bring back to she ? "
<p>
Henry blush deeply .
 " who tell you I think at all of the little rat ? " he cry .
 " who be it say at all that I care for she ? "
<p>
 " oh , the wind whisper something , " say merlin ; " and then there be some word of it in you talk cheek and you bluster just now .
I think you should be speaking to Elizabeth , not to I .
you father should have known good ? '
he voice die away .
when he spoke again it be with sad earnestness .
<p>
 " musth you leave you father , boy-and he so sure alone in the valley of man who be not like he ?
yes , I think that you musth go .
the plan of boy be serious thing and unchangeable .
but what can I say to you to keep you here , young Henry ?
you father scend I a task difficult to fulfill .
<p>
 " I go out on a tall Spanish ship a thousand year ago it musth be more than that , or perhaps I do not go at all and only dream it .
we came at last on these green Indies , and they be lovely but unchanging .
they cycle be a green monotony .
if you go there you musth give up the year ; musth lose the pang of utter dread in the deep winter with it bode that the world have flee solar fealty to go careen into lonely space so that spring may never come again .
And you musth lose that wild , excited quicken when the sun turn back , the joy of it flood over you like the surge of a warm wave and choke you with pleasure and relief .
No change there ; none at all .
past and future mingle in an odious , eternal now . "
<p>
 " but there be no change here , " young Henry interpose .
 " year on top of year be the crop put in and new calve lick by they mother ; year on top of year be a pig slaughter and the ham smoke .
spring come surely , but nothing happen . "
<p>
 " true enough , blind boy ; and I see that we be talk of different thing . "
merlin look out of he window to the mountain and the valley , and a great love for the land shine in he eyes ; but when he turn back to the boy there be the look of pain in he face .
he voice take on the cadence of a song .
<p>
 " I will plead with you for this dear Cambria where time be pile mountain high and crumble , ancient days about it base , " he cry passionately .
 " have you lose you love of wild Cambria that you would leave it when the blood of you thousand ancestor have go soak into the soil to keep it Cambria for always ?
have you forget that you be of the Trojan race ?
ah , but they wander too , do they , when Pergamus fell in ? "
<p>
Henry say , " I have lose no love , sir , but I dream be over the sea that I do not know .
I know Cambria . "
<p>
 " but , boy , here great Arthur live who drive he standard into Rome and sail away undying to dear Avalon .
And Avalon she lie off we coast , somewhere over the sink city ; there it floats endlessly .
And have you not hear them , Henry , the ghost of all those good , brave quarrelsome , inefficient man Llaw Giffes and Belerius and Arthur and Cadwallo and brute ?
they walk like cloud through the land and guard it from the high place .
there be no ghost in the Indies , and no Tylwyth teg .
<p>
 " in these wild , black hill there be a million mystery .
have you found out the chair of Arthur or the meaning of the circle stone ?
have you hear the voice that cry out triumph in the night , and the hunter of soul with they scream horn and they pack of blue hound who rush into the village on the storm ? "
<p>
 " I have hear them , " say Henry , shudder .
he glance shyly at the dog asleep on the floor and spoke in a lower tone .
 " the curate say these thing be lie .
he say the Red book be a book for little child before the fire and a shame for man and big boy to be believe in .
he tell we at church school these be lie tales , and unchristian .
Arthur be an unimportant chieftain , he say , and merlin , who name you bear , a figment of the mad brain of Jeffery of Monmouth .
he spoke ill of the Tylwyth teg and of the corpse-candle , and of such as he honour , you dog , here . "
<p>
 " oh , the fool ! " cry merlin in disgust .
 " the fool breaking these thing !
And he offer instead a storey to the world by twelve collaborator with rather slovenly conviction in some matter .
why musth you go boy ?
do you not see that the enemy of Cambria fight no more with the sword , but with little pointed tongues ? "
the harp sing he question , then slowly cease they throb , and there be silence in the round house .
<p>
Henry studied the floor with drawn brow .
at last he say , " there be so much bother about I .
I can seem to talk of this thing , merlin .
I will come back .
surely I will when this burning for new thing be quench .
but do you see that I musth go , for it seem that I be cut in half and only one part of I here .
the other piece be over the sea , calling and calling I to come and be whole .
I love Cambria , and I will come back when I be whole again . "
<p>
merlin search the boy face closely .
sadly he look up at he harp .
 " I think I understand , " he say softly .
 " you be a little boy .
you want the moon to drink from as golden cup ; and so , it be very likely that you will become a great man-if only you remain a little child .
all the world great have be little boy who want the moon running and climbing , they sometimes catch a firefly .
but if one grow to a man mind , that mind musth see that it can have the moon and would not want it if it could . -and so , it catch no firefly .
<p>
 " but do you never want the moon ? " ask Henry in a voice hush with the room quiet .
<p>
 " I want it .
above all desire I want it .
I reach for it and then-then I grow to be a man , and a failure .
but there be this gift for the failure ; folk know he have fail , and they be sorry and kindly and gentle .
he have the whole world with he ; a bridge of contact with he own people ; the cloth of mediocrity .
but he who shield a firefly in he hands , catch in reach for the moon , be doubly alone ; he only can realize he true failure , can realize he meanness and fear and evasion .
<p>
 " you will come to you greatness , and it may be in time you will be alone in you greatness and no friend anywhere ; only those who hold you in respect or fear or awe .
I be sorry for you , boy with the straight , clear eyes which look upward longingly .
I be sorry for you , and heaven ! how I envy you . "
<p>
dusk be steal into the mountain crease , filling them with purple mist .
the sun cut she on a sharp hill and bleed into the valley .
long shadow of the peak creep out into the field like stalk grey cat .
when merlin spoke , it be with a little laugh .
<p>
 " do not think deeply of I word , " he say , " for I she be not at all sure of them .
dream you may know by a quality we call inconsistency-but how could you classify the lightning ? "
now the night be close in quickly , and Henry jump to he foot .
<p>
 " oh , but I musth be going !
the dark be in ! "
<p>
 " yes , you musth go , but do not think closely of I word .
I may have be trying to impress you with these word .
Old man need a certain silent flattery when they have come to distrust that which be speak .
only remember that merlin talk with you .
And if you come on the Welsh folk anywhere , sing I song that be make so long ago , tell them that you know I ; tell them that I be a glorious creature with blue wing .
I do want to be forget , Henry .
that be great horror to an old man than death-to be forget . "
<p>
Henry say , " I musth be going now ; it's really dark .
And thank you , sir , for telling I these thing , but you see , I musth be sailing outward to the Indies . "
<p>
merlin laugh softly .
 " of course you musth , Henry .
And catch a big firefly , will you .
Good-by , child . "
<p>
Henry look back once as the black silhouette of the house sink behind the crag shoulder , but no light have flash behind the window .
Old merlin sit there pleading with he harp , and they echoed he jeeringly .
<p>
the boy quicken he step down the path .
all below be a black lake ; and the farm lights star reflectance in it deep .
the wind have die , leave a thick silence on the hill .
everywhere the sad , soundless ghost flit about they haunting .
Henry walk carefully , he eyes on the path which glimmer pale blue before he .
<p>
1 . 1 . 3 IV
on the path there be the dark , Henry mind go back to the first speech of merlin .
should he see Elizabeth before he go sailing away ?
he do not like she ; sometimes he think he have discover hatred for she , and this he nurse and warm only to feel it grow to a desire to see she .
<p>
she be a thing of mystery .
all girl and woman hoard something they never spoke of .
he mother have terrific secret about biscuit , and cry , sometimes , for no known reason .
another life go on inside of woman-some woman-run parallel to they outward live and yet never cross them .
<p>
A year before ; Elizabeth have be a pretty child who whisper to the other girl and giggle and pull hair when he be about ; and then suddenly she have change .
It be nothing Henry could see , exactly , but rather he feel that a deep , quiet understanding have be give she .
It frighten he , this wisdom which have come all at once to Elizabeth .
<p>
then there be she body-different somehow from he , and capable , it be whisper , of strange pleasure and alchemy .
even this flowering body she keep a secret thing .
A time ago they have go together to swim in the river , and she have be unconscious of it ; but now she cover she carefully from he and appear strike with the think that he might see .
she new character frighten and embarrass Henry .
<p>
sometimes he dream of she , and wake in agony lest she should ever know he dream .
And sometimes it be a strange , shadowy composite of Elizabeth and he mother that came to he in the night .
after such a dream , the day bring loathing of she and she .
he considered she an unnatural monster and she a kind of succubus incarnate .
And he could tell no one of these thing .
the people would shun he .
<p>
he think perhaps he would like to see she before he left .
there be a strange power in she this year , a drawing yet repel power which sway he desire like a windblown reed .
other boy might have go to she in the night and kiss she , after they have boast a little of they going ; but then , the other boy do not dream as he do , nor do they think of she , as he sometimes do , as a loathsome be .
there be surely something monstrous about he , for he could not distinguish between desire and disgust .
And then , she could embarrass he so easily .
<p>
No , certainly , he would not go to she .
where have Merlin-where have any one catch the idea that he care a farthing for she , the daughter of a poor tenant ?
not worth bother about !
<p>
footstep be coming down the path behind he , loud clash in the quiet night , and soon a quick , thin figure came up with he .
<p>
 " might it be William ? " Henry ask politely , while the road-mender stopped in the path and shift he pick from one shoulder to the other .
<p>
 " It's William right enough .
And what be you doing on the path , and the dark come ? "
<p>
 " I've be to see merlin and to hear he talk . "
<p>
 " pest on he !
That's all he ever do now .
once he make song-good , sweet song as I could repeat to you if I'd a mind to-but now he roost up on that Crag-top like an old molt eagle .
once when I be going past I spoke to he about it , too , as I can prove by he .
I'm not a man to be holding I tongue when I've be thinking .
<p>
 " why be you making no more song ? ' I say to he in a tone like that .
'Why be you making no more song ? '
'I have grown to be a man , ' he answer , 'and there be no song in a man .
only child make song-child and idiot . '
pest on he !
It's an idiot she , be the think be on I .
but what do he say to you , the old whitebeard ? "
<p>
 " why , you see , I'm going to the Indies and "
 " the Indies , and be you ?
ah , well-I be at London once .
And all the people at London be thieve , dirty thieve .
there be a man with a board and little flat stick on it .
'Try you skill , friend ? ' he say .
'What stick have a black mark on the underside of it ? '
'That one , ' say I ; and so it be .
but the next time , well , he be a thief , too ; all of them thieve .
<p>
 " people there be at London , and they do nothing but drive about and about in carriage , up one street and down another , bowing to each other , while good man sweat out they live in the field and the mine to keep them bowing there .
what chance have I or you , say , with all the fine , soft place take up by robber ?
And can you tell I the thieve price of an egg at London ? "
<p>
 " I musth take this road now , " say Henry .
 " I musth go home . "
<p>
 " Indies . "
the road-mender sigh with longing .
then he spit in the trail .
 " ah , well stake it's all thieve there , too . "
<p>
the night be very black when Henry came at last to the poor hut where Elizabeth live .
there be a fire in the middle of the floor , he know , and the smoke drift up and try to get out at a small hole in the thatch .
the house have no flooring , but only rush strew on the pack ground , and when the family sleep they wrapped she in sheepskin and lay in a circle with they foot to the fire .
<p>
the window be not glaze nor curtain .
Henry could see old black Twym and he thin , nervous wife , moving about inside .
he watch for Elizabeth to pass the window , and when at last she do , he whistle a shrill bird-call .
the girl stopped and look out , but Henry be quiet in the dark .
then Elizabeth open the door and stand frame against the inside light .
the fire be behind she .
Henry could see the black outline of she figure through she diving .
he saw the fine curve of she leg and the swell of she hip .
A wild shame fill he , for she and for she .
without think and without reason he run away into the dark , gasp and almost sob under he breath .
<p>
1 . 1 . 4 V
Old Robert look up hopefully when the boy came into the room , and then the hope die away and he turn quickly to the fire .
but mother Morgan jump from she seat and go angrily to Henry .
<p>
 " what be this foolishness ?
you going to the Indies ! " she demand .
<p>
 " but , mother , I musth go ; truly I musth-and father understand .
can you hear how the Indies be calling to I ? "
<p>
 " that I can !
It's wicked nonsense be in it .
A little child you be , and not to be trust from home at all .
besides , you own father be going to tell you it may not be . "
<p>
the strong jaw of the boy set like a rock and the muscle stand out in he cheek .
suddenly there came a flash of anger into he eyes .
<p>
 " then , mother , if you will not understand , I tell you that I be going the morrow-in spite of all of you . "
<p>
hurt pride chase incredulity from she face , and that , too , pass , leave only pain .
she shrink from the bewilder hurt .
And Henry , when he saw what he word have done , go quickly to she .
<p>
 " I'm sorry , Mother-so very sorry ; but why can you not let I go as I father can ?
I do want to hurt you , but I musth go .
will you see that ? "
he put he arm about she , but she would not look at he .
she eyes stare blankly straight in front of she .
<p>
she be so sure that she view be right .
throughout she life she have insult and browbeat and scold she family , and they have known she little tyranny to be the outcrop of she love for them .
but now that one of them , and he the child , have used the tone she spoke with every hour , it make a grim hurt that might never be quite heal again .
<p>
 " you spoke with merlin ?
what do he say to you ? ask Robert from the hearth .
<p>
Henry mind flash quickly to Elizabeth .
 " he talk of thing that be not in I belief , " he say .
<p>
 " Well-it be only a chance , " murmur Robert .
 " You've hurt you mother badly , boy , " he go on .
 " I've never see she so-so quiet . "
then Robert straighten she and he voice become firm .
<p>
 " I have five pound for you , son .
It's little enough ; I suppose I might give you a small matter more , but not enough to help much .
And here be a letter recommend you to I brother , sir Edward .
he go out before the kingbolt be murder , and for some reason-perhaps because he be quiet-old Cromwell have let he stay .
if he be there when you come to Jamaica , you may present this letter ; but it's a cold , strange man who take great pride in he rich acquaintance , and might be a little annoy with a poor relative .
And so I do not know that good will come of this letter .
he would dislike you unless you be able to see nothing funny in a man who look like I , only stride about with a silver sword and plume on he head .
I laugh once , and he have not be a near brother to I since .
but keep the letter , it may help you with other people if not with you uncle . "
<p>
he look at he wife sitting huddle in the shadow .
 " Will we not have supper , mother ? "
<p>
she make no sign that she hear he , and Robert she pour the pot and bring the food to the table .
<p>
It be a cruel thing to lose a son for who you have live continuously .
somehow , she have imagine he always beside she-a little boy , and always beside she .
she try to think of the coming days , and Henry not there , but the think be shatter on the bleak wall of a lean imagination .
she attempt to consider he ungrateful so to run away from she ; she recall the harsh blow he have deal she-but always the mind snap back .
Henry be she little boy , and , naturally , he could not be mean nor treacherous .
in some way , when all this talk and pain have drift into the thin air , he would be yet beside she , deliciously underfoot .
<p>
she mind which have be always a scalpel of reality , she imagination which deal purely with the . present outsides of thing , go fondle back to the baby who have crawl and stumble and learned to talk .
she forget that he be going away at all , so deeply be she lave in a reverie of the silver past .
<p>
he be be baptize in a long white diving .
all the water of baptism collected in one big drop and roll down he blobby nose , and she , in she passion for tidiness , wipe it off with a handkerchief and then wonder if he should be baptize again .
the young curate be perspire and choke over he word .
he be lately come to the parish and be only a local boy anyway .
he be really too young , she think , to be trust with an affair of this importance .
perhaps it would take .
he might get the word in the wrong order or something .
And then-Robert have make a mess of he waistcoat again .
he never could get the right button in the right hole to save he .
It make he look all rack to one side .
she musth go and tell Robert about he waistcoat before people in the church notice it .
small thing like that be sure to cause talk .
but could she trust this foolish young curate not to let the baby fall while she go ?
<p>
supper be over , and aged Gwenliana rose from the table to struggle back to she seat before the fire .
quietly she be slip back into she friendly future .
<p>
 " what time will you be start , the morning ? " ask Robert .
<p>
 " why , about seven , I think , father . "
Henry try to sound casual .
<p>
the ancient woman pause in she journey and look sharply at he .
<p>
 " now where be Henry going ? " she ask .
<p>
 " why , do you know ?
Henry be going away from we in the morning .
he be going to the Indies . "
<p>
 " And not coming back again ? " she question anxiously .
<p>
 " not for a time , anyway .
It's a great distance . "
<p>
 " why , but-I musth lay the future before he then , that's what I musth do before he like the white page of an open book , " she exclaim in please excitement .
 " I musth tell he of the future and the thing in it .
let I look at you , boy . "
<p>
Henry go to she and sit at she foot while she talk .
there be truly a spell in the ancient Cumric tongue .
It be a speech make for prophecy .
<p>
 " of course , " Gwenliana say , " if I have only known of this today I should have get the shoulder bone of a new-kill sheep .
It's a means of great antiquity and good think of than just snap-prophecy .
And since I have grown old and rusty and lame I can go about any more to meet the spirit that wander the high-road .
you can do as well if there be not the means in you to walk amongst the stroll dead and listen to they thought .
but I shall give you a thorough life , grandson , and as fine a future as I ever ponder on . "
<p>
she lean back in she chair and closed she eyes , but if one have look closely he might have see they glint below the lid where they peer out at the set face of the boy .
A long time she sit entrance , and it seem that she old brain comb out the tangle of the past to make a straight , tellable future .
at length she spoke in the low , hoarse , chant voice that be reserved for dread thing .
<p>
 " this be the tale out of Abred , when earth and water battle .
And from the impact of they clash be born a little , struggle life to squirm upward through the circle toward Gwynfyd , the sheen purity .
in that first blunder flesh be write the world history and the world journey through the void .
<p>
 " And thou-often have Annwn set it fanged maw to entrap the little pinch of life thou carryest about , but thou hast make thy path to go around it snare .
A thousand century hast thou live since earth and sea struggle in thy generation , and a thousand eon shalt thou carry about the little pinch of life that be give thee , so only thou shelterest it from Annwn , the chaos . "
<p>
always she begin she prophecy thus .
It be a thing teach she by a wandering bard , to who it have come , from bard to bard , back and back to the white Druid .
Gwenliana pause to let she word find footing in the boy brain .
she continue : " this be the tale of thy present wandering .
thou shalt become a great shine for the divine , teaching the thing of God . "
she secret eyes saw the boy face fall in disappointment , and she cry : " but wait a moment !
I go too far ahead .
there shall be fight and shed of blood , and the sword shall be thy first bride . "
Henry face light up with pleasure .
 " the whisper of thy name shall be a foregather command to the warrior of the world .
thou shalt sack the city of the infidel and spoil he of he plunderings .
the terror will precede thee like a scream eagle over the shield of man . "
she know , now , that she forecast be a success , but she hasten on to great glory .
<p>
 " the government of island and continent shall be thine , and thou shalt bring justice and peace to them .
And at last , when thou art gird with honour and repute , thou shalt marry a white maiden of mighty rank-a girl of good family , and wealthy , " she finished .
she eyes open and she glance about for they approbation .
<p>
 " I could have done good with a sheep shoulder , " she say plaintively , " or if I could be walking about on the high-road now and then ; but age rob you of you little pleasure and leave you with only a cold , quiet wait . "
<p>
 " ah , well , mother , it be a good prophecy , " say Old Robert ; " as good as I ever hear you make .
you be just coming to the peak of you occult strength , I think .
And you have take away I dread and reassure I about Henry going .
now I be only proud of what I boy be to be .
only I wish he do have to kill people . "
<p>
 " well , then-if you think it be really good ! " say Gwenliana happily .
 " It do seem to I that the air be propitious and I eyes clear tonight .
still , I should have like a sheep shoulder . "
she closed she eyes contentedly and go to doze .
<p>
1 . 1 . 5 VI
all night Old Robert toss nervously in he bed , and he wife lay motionless beside he .
at last , when the darkness be change to silver grey in the window , she rose quietly .
<p>
 " what ?
have you not be sleep , mother ?
And where be you going ? "
<p>
 " I be going to Henry , now .
I musth talk with he .
perhaps he will listen to I . "
only a moment she be go , and then she return and lay she head on Robert arm .
<p>
 " Henry be go , " she say , and she whole body stiffen a little .
<p>
 " go ?
but how could he do that ?
here be he first cowardice , mother .
he be afraid to say good-by to we .
but I be not sorry for he fear , because it hold the sureness of he sorrow .
he could not bear to hear the thing of he feeling in word .
<p>
 " why , mother ! "
he be startle at she silence and she coldness .
 " he will come back to we , mother , in a little ; perhaps when the spring grass be lift out .
surely he will come back to we .
I swear it .
can you believe it ?
he be go only for a week-a few days .
oh , believe I !
<p>
 " the year be go from we surely , dear , and now we be as we be-do you remember ? -only closer-closer of all the thing that have be .
we be rich with all the little picture of the past and the thing he play with .
they can never go from we while life be here . "
<p>
she do not weep nor move nor even seem to breathe .
 " oh , I wife-Elizabeth say that you will believe in he coming , very soon-soon-before you have miss he , " he cry wildly .
 " do not lie there silently and lose .
he will be here when the spring come in .
you musth believe it , dear-I dear . "
Very softly he stroke the still cheek beside he with he great tender finger .
<p>
1 . 1 . 6 VII
he have creep from the house in the false dawn , and start briskly walking on the road to Cardiff .
there be a freeze , frighten thing in he heart , and a wonder whether he want to go at all .
to he mind the fear have argue that if he wait to say good-by he would not be able to leave the stone house , not even for the Indies .
<p>
the sky be grey as he go by pasture where he have toss and play , and by the quarry where be the cave in which he and he friend act the delightful game of " robber , " with Henry always the wild wag , Twym shine Catti , by acclamation .
<p>
the mountain stand sharply before he , like cardboard thing and along they rim a silver fringe .
A little wind of dawn blow down the slope , fresh and sweet smell , bearing the rich odour of moisten earth and leave .
horse whinny shrilly at he as he pass , then came close and gently touched he with they soft nose ; and covey of bird , feed on belated night crawler in the half dark , fly up at he approach with startle protest .
<p>
by sun-up there be new mile behind he .
As the yellow ball slide from behind the peak , coloring all the tatter cloud of the mountain , Henry draw a thick curtain down against the past .
the pain and loneliness that have walk with he in the dark be pushed back and left behind he .
Cardiff be ahead .
he be coming to new country which he have never see before , and below the morning horizon , faint and glorious , seem to glow the green crown of the Indies .
<p>
he pass through village who name be unknown to he ; friendly little cluster of rude hut , and the people stare at he as at a stranger .
It be a joyous thing to young Henry .
always he have stare at other who be stranger , dream they destination and the delicious mystery that send them forth .
the name of stranger make them grand being with mighty purpose .
And now he be a stranger to be think about and stare at with a certain reverence .
he want to shout , " I'm on I way to the Indies , " to widen they dull eyes for them and raise they respect .
silly , spineless creature , he think them , with no dream and no will to leave they sodden , dumpy hut .
<p>
the land change .
he be coming out of the mountain to a broad , unbounded country of little roll and flat lands .
he saw large burrow like the hole of tremendous gopher , and dirty black man coming out of them with sack of coal on they back .
the miner empty they sack in a pile on the ground and then walk back into the burrow .
he notice that they stoop when they walk as though the heavy bags be still bearing them down .
<p>
midday came , and a long , clear afternoon , and still he trudge on .
there be a new odour in the air , the sweet , compelling breath of the sea .
he want to break into a run toward it like a thirsty horse .
in the late afternoon an army of black cloud draw over the sky .
A wind rush out with snow in it breath , and the grass bow before it .
<p>
still he go on into the gathering storm until it be armed with sleet which prick he face viciously , and until the cold go piercing through he jacket .
there be occasional house to either side of the road , but Henry would seek shelter and food at none of them .
he do not know the customs of this place , nor the price of thing , and he five pound musth be intact when he came at last to Cardiff .
<p>
at length , when he hands be blue and he face raw with the wild sleet , he crawl into a lonely , stone barn fill with the summer hay .
It be warm , there , and quiet after the scream of the wind in he ear .
the hay be sweet with the honey dry in it stem .
Henry burrow into the soft bed and sleep .
<p>
It be dark night when he awaken .
Half-dream , he remember where he be , and at once the thought which he have shut from he the day before throng back with clamour strident voice .
<p>
 " you be a fool , " say one .
 " remember the big room and the pike and the bright fire !
where be they now ?
oh , you will not see them any more .
they be go out like thing of dream , and you do not even know where dream go .
you be a fool ! "
<p>
 " No , no ; listen to I !
think of I !
why do you not wait for Elizabeth ?
be you afraid ?
yes , you be afraid .
this boy be a coward , brother .
he be afraid of a small girl with yellow hair-a tenant daughter . "
<p>
A sad , slow voice break in .
 " think of you mother , Henry .
she be sitting straight and still when you last saw she .
And you do not go to she .
you only look from the doorway as you go .
perhaps she have die in she chair , with the look of hurt in she eyes .
how can you tell ?
And Robert , you own father-Will you think of he , now-lonely , and sad , and lose .
It's you doing , Henry because you want to go to the Indies you do not think of any one else . "
<p>
 " And what do you know of the future ? " ask a tiny , fearful voice .
 " It will be cold , and perhaps you will freeze .
or some stranger may kill you for you money , little as it be .
such thing have happen .
always there have be some one to look after you and to see that you be comfortable .
oh , you will starve ! you will freeze ! you will die !
I be sure of it ! "
<p>
then the noise of the barn edge in amongst he tormentor .
the storm be past , but a breeze sigh around corner with infinite , ghostly sadness .
now and again it voiced a little wail of sorrow .
there be a creak in the hay as though every straw squirm and try to move stealthily .
bat flit about in the dark gnash they tiny tooth , and the mouse be scream horribly .
bat and mouse seem to be glaring at he from obscurity with small , mean eyes .
<p>
he have be alone before , but never so thoroughly alone , amongst new thing , in a place he do not know .
the terror be grow and swelling in he breast .
time have become an idle worm which crawl ahead the merest trifle , stopped and waggle it blind head , and crawl again .
It seem that hours pass over he like slow , sailing cloud while he lay shiver with fright .
at last an owl fly in and circle above he , screech maniacally .
<p>
the boy overstrung nerves snap , and he run whimpering from the barn and down the road toward Cardiff .
<p>
1 . 2 chapter II
FOR more than a century Britain have watch with impatience while Spain and Portugal , with the permission of the Pope , divided the New world and patrol they property to keep out interloper .
It be a bitter thing to England there imprison by the sea .
but finally drake have burst the barrier and sail the forbid ocean in he little golden Hind .
the great red ship of Spain considered drake only a tiny , sting fly , an annoy thing to be kill for it buzz ; but when the fly have gut they floating castle , burned a town or two , and even set a traprock for the sacred treasure train across the isthmus , they be forced to alter they conception .
the fly be a hornet , a scorpion , a viper , a dragon .
they name he el Draque , and a fear of the English grow up in the New world .
<p>
when the armada fell before the English and the angry sea , Spain be terrify at this new force which emanate from such a very little island .
It be sad to think of these bright carve ship lie on the bottom or tear to fragment on the Irish coast .
<p>
And Britain thrust she hand into the Caribbean ; a few island came under she power-Jamaica , Barbados .
now the product of the home island could be sell in colony .
It add prestige to a little country to have colony , provided they be strongly populate ; and England begin to populate she new possession .
<p>
young son , spendthrift , ruin gentleman sail out for the Indies .
It be a fine way to be rid of a dangerous man .
the kingbolt have only to grant he land in the Indies and then express the desire that he live on he property and cultivate the rich soil there for the good of the English crown .
<p>
the out-sailing ship be crowded with colonist ; gambler , tout , pimp , dissenter , papist-all to own the land , and none to work it .
the slave ship of Portugal and the Netherlands could not move black flesh from Africa fast enough to supply the increase demand of those who clamour for worker .
<p>
then felon be gather out of the prison , and vagrant from the street of London ; beggar who stand all day before the church door ; those suspect of witchcraft or treason or leprosy or papism ; and all these be send to work the plantation under order of indenture .
It be a brilliant plan ; the labor need be supply , and the crown actually receive money for the worthless body of those it once feed and clothe and hang .
more could be make of this .
whole sheave of order of indenture , ready seal by the government , with blank space for name , be sell to certain captain of ship .
they be give instructions to act with extreme discretion about the name they fill in .
<p>
And row of coffee and orange and cane and cocoa grow and ever spread out on the island .
there be some little trouble , of course , when the terms of indenture run out .
but the slum of London breed new slave quickly enough , God know ! and the kingbolt be never without a fine supply of enemy .
<p>
England be becoming a sea power with she governor and palace and clerk in the New world , and ship of manufacture thing be sailing out of Liverpool and Bristol in ever increase number .
<p>
1 . 2 . 1 I
with breaking day , Henry be in the outskirts of Cardiff , all he terror go and a new blossom wonder in he .
for it be an unbelievable thing , this city of house , rank on rank-no two of them exactly alike-the lines of them stretch out endlessly like an army in the mud .
he have never considered such magnitude when people spoke of city .
<p>
the shop be opening they shutter , putt they goods on display , and Henry stare wide-eyed into every one as he pass .
Down a long street he go until he came at last to the dock with they field of mast like grow wheat , and they cloud and cobwebs of brown rigging in an apparent frenzy of disorder .
there be loading of bundle and barrel and slaughter animal into some of the ship , and other be scend out of they curve belly goods in queer foreign box and sack of braided straw .
A tremendous bustle of excitement live about the dock .
the boy feel that holiday tingle which . have come to he when man be putt up pavilion for a fair at home .
<p>
A loud song burst out of a ship just get under weigh , and the word be clear , beautiful foreign word .
the water slap smooth hull be a joy to he to the point of pain .
he feel that he have come home again to a known , love place , after days and nights of mad delirium .
now a great song of many voice came from the moving barque , and it brown anchor rose from the water ; it sail drop from the yard and catch the morning wind .
the barque slide from it berth and move softly down the channel .
<p>
onward he walk to where the ship be careen , showing weed and barnacle , gather in many ocean , hanging to they shine side .
here be the short , quick hammer of the calkers and the rasp of iron on wood , and brusque command build up to roar by the speaking trumpet .
<p>
when the sun be well up , Henry begin to feel hungry .
he wander slowly back to the town to find he breakfast , reluctant to leave the dock even for food .
now the crimp be coming out of they hole , and the sniffle gambler who prey on sailor .
here and there a dishevel , sleepy-eyed woman scurry homeward as though fear to be catch by the sun .
seaman on shore leave rub they puff eyes and look into the sky for weather sign as they lounge against the wall , Henry wonder what these man have see in the sailing days of they live .
he step aside for a line of cart and tumbrel leaded with box and bail for the ship , and immediately have to dodge another line coming away , loaded with goods from across the sea .
<p>
he came at last to a busy inn .
 " the three dog " it be call , and there they be on the sign look very like three startle dromedary .
Henry enter and found a large apartment crowded with people .
of a fat man in an apron he ask whether he could get breakfast .
<p>
 " have you money ? " the host ask suspiciously .
<p>
Henry let the light fall on a gold piece in he hand , and , as he have make the sign of power , the apron be bowing and gently pull he by the arm .
Henry order he breakfast and stand look around the inn .
<p>
there be a great many people in the room sitting at the long table or leaning against the wall ; some , even , be seat on the floor .
A little serving girl go amongst them with a tray of liquor .
some be Italian from the ship of Genoa and Venice , come with rare woods and spice that have be carry overland on camel back from the Indian ocean to Byzantium .
Frenchman be there from the wine boat of Bordeaux and Calais , with an occasional square-face , blue-eyed Basque amongst them .
Swede and Dane and Finn be in from the whaler of the north ocean , dirty man who smell of decay blubber ; and at some of the table be cruel Dutchman who make a business of carry black slave from Guinea to Brazil .
scatter amongst these foreign man be a few Cambrian farmer , look frighten and self conscious and alone .
they have bring pig and sheep from the country for victual the ship , and now be bolt they food so that they might get home again before nightfall .
these look for security to three man of war man wearing the kingbolt uniform who talk together by the door .
<p>
young Henry lose she in the lovely clamour of the room .
he be hearing new speech and seeing new sight : the earring of the Genoese ; the short knife-like sword of the Dutch ; the colour of face from beet red to wind bite brown .
all day he might have stand there with no knowledge in he of the passing of time .
<p>
A big hand take he elbow , a hand glove in callus ; and Henry look down into the broad , guileless face of an Irish seaman .
<p>
 " Will you be sitting here , young man , alongside of an honest sailor out of Cork name Tim ? "
As he spoke he squeeze violently against he neighbour , fling he sideways and leave a narrow space on the bench end for the boy .
there be no man like the Irish for be brutally gentle .
And Henry , as he take the seat , do not know that the sailor out of Cork bad see he gold piece .
<p>
 " thank you , " he say .
 " And where be it that you go sailing ? "
<p>
 " ah ! any place that ship go I do be sailing , " reply Tim .
 " I'm an honest sailor out of Cork with no fault on I save never have the shine of a coin to I pocket .
And I wonder , now , how I'm to be pay for the fine breakfast , and I with never a shine , " he say slowly and emphatically .
<p>
 " why , if you have no money , I'll buy you breakfast-so you will be telling I of the sea and ship . "
<p>
I know it be a gentleman you be , " Tim cry .
 " I know it the minute I eyes landed on you soft like-And a small drink to be start with ? "
he shout for he drink without wait for Henry consent , and when it came , raise the brown liquor to he eyes .
<p>
 " Uisquebaugh , the Irish call it .
that means water of life ; and the English call it 'Whiskey'-only water .
why ! if water have the fine body and honest glow of this , it's sailing I would give up and take to swim ! "
he laugh uproariously and tip the glass up .
<p>
 " I'm going to the Indies , " Henry observe , with think to bring he back to talk of the sea .
<p>
 " the Indies ?
why , so be I , tomorrow in the morning ; and for Barbados with knife and sickle and diving goods for the plantation .
It's a good ship-a Bristol ship-but the master a hard man all stiff with religion out of the colony at Plymouth .
Hell-file he roar at you and call it prayer and repentance , but I'm thinking there's joy in all the burning to he .
We'll all burn a good time if he have he way .
I do not understand the religion of he ; there's never an Ave Mary about it , and so how can it be religion at all ? "
<p>
 " do you think-do you think , perhaps-I could go in you ship with you ? " Henry ask chokingly .
<p>
the lid draw down over the ingenuous eyes of Tim .
<p>
 " if it be ten pound you have , " he say slowly , and then , seeing the sorrow on the boy face , " five , I mean "
 " I have something over four , now , " Henry break in , with sadness .
<p>
 " well , and four might do it , too .
you give I you four pound , and I'll be talk with the master .
It's not a bad man when you get to be knowing he , only queer and religious .
No , do be look at I like that .
you come along with I .
I would run off with the four pound of a boy that buy I breakfast at all . "
he face bloomed with a great smile .
<p>
 " come , " he say ; " let be drink that you go with we in the Bristol girl .
Uisquebaugh for I and wine of Oporto for you ! "
then breakfast arrive and they fell to eating .
after a few mouthful Henry say : " I name be Henry Morgan .
what be you other name besides Tim ? "
<p>
And the sailor laugh heartily .
<p>
 " why , if there be ever a name to I but Tim you might find it kick around in a wheel rut at Cork .
the father and mother of I do not wait to be telling I I name .
but Tim be on I without give .
Tim be a kind of free name that you can just take and no one to mention it , like the little paper the dissenter be leave in the street , and they scuttle off not to be see with them .
you can breathe Tim like the air , and no one to put hand on you . "
<p>
breakfast over , they go into the street , busy with the trade of carter and orange boy and peddle old woman .
the town be crying it thousand wares , and it seem that delicate thing fro the far , unearthly corner of the world have be bring by the ship and dump like clod on the dusty counter of Cardiff : lemon ; case of coffee and tea and cocoa ; bright eastern rug ; and the weird medicine of India to make you see thing that be not , and to feel pleasure that fly away again .
standing in the street be barrel and earthen jug of wine from the bank of the Loire and the Peruvian slope .
<p>
they came again to the dock and the beautiful ship .
the smell of tar and sunburnt hemp and the sweetness of the sea breathed in to them from off the water .
at last , far down the row , Henry saw a great black ship , and Bristol girl paint in letters of gold on she prow .
And the town and all the flat hulk become ugly and squalid beside this beauty of the sea .
the curve running lines of she and the sensuous sureness of she be tonic thing to make you gasp in you breath with pleasure .
New white sail cling to she yard like long , slender cocoon of silk worms , and there be fresh yellow paint on she deck .
she lay there lift slightly on a slow swell , champ , impatient to be flying off to any land of you imagination .
A black Sheban queen she be , amongst the dull brown boat of the harbour .
<p>
 " oh , it's a grand ship-a fine ship , " cry Henry , wonder-struck .
<p>
Tim be proud .
 " but only come aboard of she , and see the fitting-all new .
I'll be talk with the master about you . "
<p>
Henry stand in the waist while the big seaman walk aft and pull he cap before a lean skeleton of a man in a wear uniform .
<p>
 " I have a boy , " he say , though Henry could not hear ; " a boy that's set he heart on the Indies , and I'm thinking you might be liking to take he , sir . "
<p>
the hungry master scowl at he .
<p>
 " Is he a strong boy who might be some good in the island , boatswain ?
So many of them die within the mouth , and there you have trouble the next trip . "
<p>
 " he be there , behind I , sir .
you can see he she , standing there-and very well make and close knit he be too . "
<p>
the hungry master appraise Henry , running he eyes from the sturdy leg to the full chest .
he approval grow .
<p>
 " he be a strong boy , all right ; and good work for you , Tim .
you shall have drink money of it and a little extra ration of rummy at sea .
but do he know anything about the arrangement ? "
<p>
 " never a bit . "
<p>
 " well , then , do tell he .
put he to working in the galley .
He'll think he's working out he passage .
No use of caterwaul and disturb the man off watch .
let he find out when he get there . "
the master smile and pace away from Tim .
<p>
 " you can be going with we in the ship , " the sailor cry , and Henry could not move for he pleasure .
 " but , " Tim continue seriously , " the four pound be not enough for passage .
You'll be working a bit in the galley and we sailing . "
<p>
 " anything , " Henry say , " anything I'll do , so only I can go with you . "
<p>
 " then let she go ashore and have a toast to a fine , free voyage ; uisquebaugh for I , and that same grand wine for you . "
<p>
they sit in a dusty shop who wall be line with bottle of all shape and volume , little pudgy flask to giant demijohn .
after a time they sing together , beating out the measures with they hands and smile foolishly at each other .
but at length the warm wine of Oporto fill the boy with a pleasant sadness .
he feel that there be tears coming to he eyes , and he be rather glad of it .
It would show Tim that he have he sorrow-that he be not just a feather-head boy with a crave to go to the Indies .
he would reveal he depth .
<p>
 " do you know , Tim , " he say , " there be a girl I came away from , and she be name Elizabeth .
she hair be gold-gold like the morning .
And on the night before I came away , I call to she and she came to I in the dark ; the dark be all about we like a tent , and cold .
she cry and cry for I to stay , even when I tell she of the fine thing and the trinket and the silk I would bring back to she in a little time .
she would not be comfort at all , and it's a sad thing on I to be thinking of she crying there for I leave . "
the full tears came into he eyes .
<p>
 " I know " say Tim softly .
 " I know it's a sad thing to a man to be leave a girl and running off to sea .
have I left hundred of them-and all beautiful ?
but here's another cup to you , boy .
wine be good to a woman than all the sweet paste of France , and a man drink it .
wine make every woman lovely .
ah ! if the homely one would only put out a little font of wine in the door of they house like the holy water to a church , there would be more marriage in the town .
A man would never know the lack they have for look .
but have another cup of the grand wine , sad boy , and it may be a princess , and you leave she behind you . "
<p>
1 . 2 . 2 II
they be start for the Indies-the fine , far Indies where boy dream live .
the great sun of the morning lay struggle in grey mist , and on the deck the seaman swarm like the angry populace of a break hive .
there be short order and sailor leap up the shroud to edge along the yard .
circle man be sing the song of the capstan while the anchor rose out of the sea and cling to the side like brown , dripping moth .
<p>
off for the Indies-the white sail know it as they fling out and fill delicately as silken thing ; the black ship , know it and ride proudly on the flee tide before a fresh little morning wind .
carefully the Bristol girl creep out of the shipping and down the long channel .
<p>
the mist be slowly mix with the sky .
now the coast of Cambria become blue and pale blue until it fade into the straight horizon like a mad vision of the desert .
the black mountain be a cloud , and then a trifle of pale smoke , then Cambria be go , as though it have never be .
<p>
Porlock they pass on the port side , and Illfracombe , and many vague village tuck in the fold of Devon .
the fair , sweet wind carry them by Stratton and Camelford .
Cornwall be slip off behind them , league on blue league .
then land end , the pointed tip of Britain chin ; and , as they rounded to the southward , winter came in at last .
<p>
the sea rose up and snarl at them , while the ship run before the crying dog of the wind like a strong , confident stag , run bravely under courses and spritsail .
the wind howl out of winter home in the north , and the Bristol girl mock it across it face to the southwest .
It be cold ; the freeze shroud twang in the wind like great harp string pluck by a demented giant , and the yard groan they complaint to the tug sail .
<p>
four wild days the persistent storm chase them out to sea with the ship in joy at the struggle .
the seaman gather in the forecastle to boast of she fleetness and the tight shape of she .
And in this time Henry exult like a young god .
the wind frenzy be he frenzy .
he would stand on the deck , brace against a mast , face into the wind , cutting it with he chin as the prow cut the water , and a chant exultation fill he chest to burst joy like a pain .
the cold wipe off the lens of he eyes so that he saw more clearly into the drawn distance lie in a circle around he .
here be the old desire surfeit with a new ; for the wind bring longing to have sweeping wing and the whole , endless sky for scope .
the ship be a rock quake prison for he who would fly ahead and up .
ah ! to be a god and ride on the storm ! not under it .
here be the intoxication of the wind , a desire which satisfy desire while it lead he yearning onward .
he cry for the shoulder of omnipotence , and the element blow into he muscle a new strength .
<p>
then , as quickly as the devil servant of the year have rush at them , they slink away , leave a clear , clean sea .
the ship ride under full sail before the eternal trade wind .
It be a fresh , fair wind out of heaven , breathed by the God of navigation for the tall ship with sail .
all the tension be go from them ; the sailor play about the deck like wild , strong child-for there be young happiness in the trade wind .
<p>
Sunday came , a day of sullen fear and foreboding on the Bristol girl .
Henry finished he work in the galley and go on deck .
an aged seaman be sitting on a hatch plait a long splice .
he finger seem each a nimble intelligence as they worked , for they master never look at them .
instead , he small blue eyes , after the manner of sailor eyes , look out beyond the end of thing .
<p>
 " So you would know the secret of the lines ? " he say , without moving he gaze from the horizon .
 " well , you musth just watch .
It's so long I've be doing it that I old head have forget how ; only I finger remember .
if I think what I'm doing I get muddle up .
Will you be a sailor and go aloft one day ? "
<p>
 " why , I'd like to , if I could learn the working , " Henry say .
<p>
 " It's not so hard to learn the working .
you musth learn first to bear thing that landsman never hear of .
That's the first thing .
It's very cruel , but you may never leave it once you start .
here I've be trying to take I old hulk ashore and berth it in front of a fire for a dozen year .
I want to think awhile and die .
but it's no use .
every time I find she running I leg off to get aboard some ship or other . "
<p>
he be interrupted by a vicious ring of the ship bell .
<p>
 " come , " he say , " the master will be telling we the hot ta1es now . "
<p>
the skull-face master stand before he crew , armed with he God .
the man look fearfully at he , as small bird gaze at an approach snake , for he faith be in he eyes and word of fury fell from he thin lip .
<p>
 " God have strike you with only the title of he shatter might , " he shout .
 " he have show you the strength of he little finger that you may repent before you go scream in hell-fire .
hear the name of the lord in the frightful wind and repent you of you whorings and you blasphemy !
ah !
he will punish you even for the wicked thought in you heads .
<p>
 " there be a parable in the sea that should close about you throat like a freeze hand and choke you with the terror .
but now the storm be done you have forget it .
you be happy , and contrition be not in you .
but take warning of the lesson of the lord .
repent !
repent ! or the wrath destroy you . "
<p>
he swing he arms wildly and spoke of the poor lonely dead , suffering and burning for dear human fault ; and at last he send he man terrify away .
<p>
 " that be not so , " say the old sailor fiercely to Henry .
 " do not be taking stock in he crazy talk .
who make the storm-God or devil-make it for she and take joy of it .
what be could hurl the wind so would not be bother she about a chip of a boat floating in immensity .
I know I would not , if I be that god or devil . "
<p>
the boatswain , Tim , have come up with he last word , and now he take Henry arm protectingly .
<p>
 " true for you , " he say ; " but do not let it get back to he that you say such thing or even hear them with you ear , or he will be demonstrate the might of God to you with a rope end .
he and he God be a hard pair to be get down on you , and you a boy scrub pot in the galley . "
<p>
the trade wind blow on unceasingly , and , when he scour and peeling be done , Henry talk with the man while he lay hand to the rope and go aloft and learned the name and working of the ship gear .
the sailor found he a quiet , courteous boy with a way of look at them as though they speech be a great gift and they wise , kind man to be give it to he ; and so they teach he what they could , for very plainly this boy be born to the sea .
he learned the short and long haul chantey , the one quick and nervous and the other a slow , swing rhythm .
he sing with them the song of death and mutiny and blood in the sea .
to he lip came the peculiar , clean swear of sailor ; phrase of filth and blasphemy and horror , washed white by they utter lack of meaning in he mouth .
<p>
And in the nights he lay back quietly while the man talk of wonder see and imagine ; of mile-long serpent which coil about ship and crush and swallow them , and of turtle so huge that they have tree and stream and whole village on they back and only sink once in five hundred year .
under the swing lamp they tell how Finn could whistle up a deadly storm for they revenge ; how there be sea-rat that swim to the ship and gnaw hole through the planking until the ship sink .
they spoke shudderingly of how one , sight the dread , slimy kraken , might never see land again for the curse that be on he .
water spout be in they speech , and mooing cow that live in the sea and suckle they calve like land cow ; and ghost ship sailing endlessly about the ocean look for a lose port , they gear worked by seaman who be bleach skeleton .
And Henry , lie there , reach breathless for they word with he avidity .
<p>
 " on such a night , Tim stretch she and say , " I know nothing of you big snake at all , nor have I see the kraken , God save I !
but I've a bit of a tale she if you'll be listen .
<p>
 " 'Twas when I be a boy like this one here , and I sailing in a free ship that tuck about the ocean pick up here and there-sometimes a few black slave and now and then a gold ring from a Spanish craft that could help she-whatever we could get .
we have a master by election and no paper at all , but there be different kind of flagstone , and they on the bridge .
if we do be pick out a man of war in the glass , then we run for it .
<p>
 " well , anyway , as I'm telling you , one morning there be a little barque to the , starboard , and we wet sail to run she down ; and so we do , too .
Spanish , she be , and little enough in she but salt and green hide .
but when we turn out the cabin there be a tall , straight woman with black hair to she , and a long white forehead , and the slender finger I ever look on with I eyes .
So we take she aboard of we and do take the rest .
the captain be for leading the woman to the quarter deck alongside of he , when the boatswain step up .
<p>
 " We're a free crew , ' he say , 'and you the master by election .
we want the woman , too , ' he say , and if we do be get she there'll be a bit of mutiny in a minute . '
the captain scowl around , but there be the crew scowl back at he ; so he pull up he shoulder and laugh-a nasty kind of laugh .
<p>
 " 'How will you be decide ? ' he ask , thinking there would be a grand fight over the woman .
but the boatswain slip some dice out of he pocket and throw them on the deck .
<p>
 " 'We'll use these ! ' he say , and in a minute every man of the crew be on he knee and reach for the dice .
but 1 be taking a long sight of the woman there alone .
I say to she , 'That do be a hard kind of woman , and one that might be doing cruel thing to hurt the man she hate .
No , I boy , ' I say , 'you'd good not be coming in on the game . '
<p>
 " but just then the dark woman run to the rail and pick a round shot out of the rack and jump overside , hug it in she arms .
that be all !
we run to the rail and look-but only a few bubble there be to show .
<p>
 " well , it be two nights later , the afterwatch be for running into the forecastle and the hair bristle up on he head .
'There's a white thing , and it swim after we , ' he say , 'and the look on it like the woman that go overboard . '
<p>
 " of course we run and look over the taffrail , and I could see nothing at all ; but the other say there be a thing with long white hands reach out for we stern post , not swim but just drag after we like the ship be lodestone and it a bit of iron , you can know there be little enough sleep that night .
those that do dust off cry and moan in they sleep ; and I need not tell you what that same thing signify .
<p>
 " the next night , up come the boatswain out of the hole scream like a mad one , and the hair all turn grey on he head .
we do be holding he and pet he awhile and finally he manage to whisper , " 'I see it !
oh , I God , I see it !
there be two long , white , soft look band with slender finger-and they came through the side and start to ripping the plank off like they be paper .
oh , I God !
save I ! '
<p>
 " then we feel the ship give a list and start to settle down .
<p>
 " well , three of we came floating ashore on an extra spar , and two of them crazed-poor soul-and wild like cat .
I never do be hearing whether any other be save or not , but I'm thinking not .
And that's the near I've ever see with I eyes the thing you do be talk of .
but they say on clear nights in the Indian ocean you can be seeing the poor murder Hindu ghost chase the dead credendum Gama about in the sky .
And I have hear that these same Hindu be a very unfruitful people to pick out , and you going in for murder . "
<p>
from the first day , the cook have take it upon she " to instruct young Henry .
the man seem to crave to give information .
It be a wistful instruction , as though be fear every minute to be contradict .
he be a grey man , the cook , with sad brown eyes like a dog eyes .
there be something of a priest about he , and something of a dull lecturer , and something of a thug .
he speech have the university in it , and he unclean habit the black , bitter alley of London .
he be gentle and kind and stealthily insincere .
No one would ever give he a chance to prove she trustworthy , because the whisper seem to come from he that if it be in the least worthwhile he would be treacherous .
<p>
now they have sail into a warm sea , and a warm wind drive them on .
Henry and the cook would stand at the rail , watch the triangle fin of shark cut back and forth across they wake wait for refuse .
they saw little brown cluster of weed go floating by , and the leisurely , straight swim pilot fish on the point of the prow .
once the cook pointed to the brown bird with long , slender wing following them ; hanging , hover , dip , sway , always flying , never resting .
<p>
 " see these restless one , " the man say .
 " like quest soul they be indeed , and some say they be the soul of sailor drown , soul so thick with sin that they never rest from one year to another .
other swear that these bird lay they egg in floating nest build on plank of lose ship ; and other , still , that they have no nest at all but be born full grown of the white lip of a wave and instantly start they lifelong flight .
aye ! the restless one . "
<p>
the ship start a school of flier that skip along the wave tops like shine silver coin .
<p>
 " these be the ghost or treasure lose at sea , " the cook go on , " the murder thing , emerald and diamond and gold ; the sin of man , commit for them , stick to them and make them haunt the ocean .
aye ! it's a poor thing if a sailor will not make a grand tale about it . "
<p>
Henry pointed to a great tortoise asleep on the surface .
 " And what be the tale of the turtle ? " he ask .
<p>
 " nothing ; only food .
It be not likely that a man will be making romance about the thing he eats .
such thing be too close to he , and the romance contaminate out of them .
but these same beast have be the saving of a number of ship , and the means of making flesh on some that might otherwise be white bone on the deck of a derelict
the meat of turtle be sweet and good .
sometimes when the buccaneer be not in the way of get wild beef , they stock they ship with these and so sail . "
<p>
the sun have rush below the water as they spoke .
far off , one black cloud whip out tongue after tongue of dazzle lightning , but all the sky save that one spot be silken blue-black , litter with swarm of star .
<p>
 " you promise to speak with I of those same buccaneer , " Henry beg ; " they who you call the brethren of the coast .
tell I , do you ever sail with them ? "
<p>
the cook shift uneasily .
 " There's peace between Spain and England , " he say .
 " I would not be breaking the kingbolt peace .
No , I never sail with them ; no .
but I have hear thing which may be true .
I have hear that the buccaneer be great fool .
they plunder rich prise and then throw they gains to the tavern host and brothel keeper of Tortuga and Goaves , like child throw sand from them when they be tire of play .
oh ! great fool , I think . "
<p>
 " but do none of them ever take a town ? " Henry ask .
<p>
 " A village or so have fall to them , but they have no leader for such a thing . "
<p>
 " but a great town with a treasury ? " Henry persist .
<p>
 " No , they have never done it .
they be child , I tell you-strong , brave child . "
<p>
 " could not a man who think and plan carefully take a Spanish town ? "
<p>
 " ho ! " the cook laugh ; " and be you going to be a buccaneer ? "
<p>
 " but if a man plan carefully ? "
<p>
 " why , if there be a buccaneer who could plan at all , carefully or otherwise , it might be done ; but there be no such buccaneer .
they be little child who can fight like hell and die very nicely-but fool .
they will sink a ship for a cup of wine , when they might sell the ship . "
<p>
 " if a man considered carefully and weigh he chance and the man he have , he might "
 " yes , I suppose he might . "
<p>
 " there be one call Pierre le grand who be no fool . "
<p>
 " ah , but Pierre take one rich ship and then run home to France !
he be a fearful gambler , not a wise man .
And he may yet come back to the coast and lose it all and he head too . "
<p>
 " still , " say Henry with a grown finality , " still , I think it could be done , so only a man think about it and considered it . "
<p>
in a few days they be coming close to land .
one morning the pale ghost of a mountain be sitting on the edge of the circle .
log and branch of tree go floating by now and again , and land bird fly out to them and rest in the rigging .
<p>
they be come to the home of summer , whence it go yearly to the northern place .
in the day the sun be a glaring brass cymbal , the sky washed out and livid around it , and at night the big fish swim about the ship with curve river of pale fire flow behind them .
from off the forepeak be hurl million of flying diamond by the rage prow .
the sea be a round lake of quiet undulation , spread with a silken skin .
slowly , slowly , passing to rearward , the water set up a pleasant hypnosis in the brain .
It be like look into a fire .
one saw nothing , yet only with infinite struggle could he move he eyes ; and finally he brain dream off , though he be not sleep .
<p>
there be a peace in the tropic ocean which pass a desire for understanding .
destination be no longer an end , but only to be sailing , sailing , out of the kingdom of time .
for month and year they seem to slip onward , but , there be no impatience in the crew .
they do they work , and lay about the deck all in a strange , happy lethargy .
<p>
one day there be a little island floating in the sea , shape like a haycock and green as the first spear of barley .
It be thickly cover with a tangle , fierce growth , vine and creeper and a few dark tree .
Henry saw it with eyes that look out on enchantment .
they pass that island , and another and another , until , at last , in the blackness of a tropic early morning , the ship came in to Barbados .
it anchor splash into the sea and go tug down with the hawser flying behind them .
<p>
on the shore there be lettuce green jungle as on the little island , and farther back , plantation with straight lay row and white house with red roof ; farther still , the red soil showing like wound through the jungle of the hill ; and far behind , mountain that rose sharp and hard with the appearance of strong grey tooth .
<p>
small dug-out boat came to them , bearing rich fruit and piles of truss up fowl .
they came to sell , and to buy or steal that which the ship carry .
shine black man sing rich cadenced chant as they pull at the oar , and Henry , close against the rail , be overjoy with the new land .
It be more than he have hope .
the sight bring happy , silly tears to he eyes .
<p>
Tim be standing near , look crest-fallen and sad .
at length he came and stand in front of Henry .
<p>
 " It's grieve I to be hurt a fine boy that buy I breakfast , " he say .
 " It's grieve I so I can sleep . "
<p>
 " but you have not hurt I , " cry Henry .
 " You've bring I to the Indies where I want to be so badly . "
<p>
 " ah ! " say Tim sorrowfully , " if only I have a religion to I like the master , I might say , ''Tis God will , '-and then be forget about it .
And if I have a business or position I might be talk how a man musth live .
but I have no religion in I at all , save only an Ave Mary or a miserere dominie in storm ; and as to position , why , I'm only a poor sailor out of Cork , and it do be grieve I to hurt a boy that buy I breakfast , and I a stranger . "
he be watch a long canoe that draw near to them , six strong Caribs row it .
in the stern sit a little , nervous Englishman , who face have not tan with the year but have grown redder and redder until the tiny vein seem to be running on the outside of he skin .
in the little man pale eyes there be the light of perpetual indecision and perplexity .
he canoe bump the ship side and he climb slowly aboard and go directly to the master .
<p>
 " these it be , now , " cry Tim ; " and you will not be thinking too badly about I , will you , Henry-seeing the grief it do I ? "
<p>
the captain be shout , " galley boy !
oh , galley boy !
Morgan !
aft ! "
<p>
Henry go back to where the Englishman and the captain be standing .
he be amaze when the little colonist gingerly feel he arms and shoulder .
<p>
 " I might give ten , " he say to the captain .
<p>
 " twelve ! " the captain snap .
<p>
 " but do you really think he be worth it ?
I'm not a rich man , you see , and I just think that ten "
 " well , you may have he for eleven , but , as God see I , he's worth more .
look at the knit of he and the broad shoulder .
he will die like so many .
No , sir , he's worth more , but you may have he for eleven . "
<p>
 " well , if you really think so , " the planter say hesitantly ; and he begin pull money out of he pocket , money that be mixed with tangle string , and piece of chalk , and a bit of a quill pen , and a break key .
<p>
the master draw a paper from he pocket and show it to the boy-an order of indenture for five year , with the name Henry Morgan nicely fill in , and the British seal at the bottom .
<p>
 " but I do want to be sell , " cry Henry .
 " I do come to be sell .
I want to make I fortune and be a sailor . "
<p>
 " So you shall , " the master answer kindly , as though he give permission , " after five year .
now go along with the gentleman and let we have no caterwaul .
do you think I could run this ship just bring out boy that want to come to the Indies ?
you do you work and trust in God , and it may be a very good thing for you .
experience be never waste on the sharp albeit humble soul . "
he pushed Henry soothingly along the deck in front of he .
<p>
at last the boy found he voice .
 " Tim , " he cry , " Tim .
They're selling I , Tim .
oh , Tim , come to I ! "
but there be no answer .
Tim hear , and he be sob in he hammock like a small , whip child .
<p>
And Henry , as he climb over the side ahead of he new master , feel nothing at all .
but for a little catching in he throat , there be no sharp feeling in he-only a heavy , sodden dullness .
<p>
1 . 2 . 3 III
So Henry Morgan came to be living in Barbados by authority of a white paper which forced he life and soul and body to kneel before the pleasure of one James flower , planter .
<p>
James flower be not a hard man , and certainly he be not a very brilliant man .
he whole life have be a hunger for idea-any idea-the creation of them .
he want to conceive idea , to warm them to throb life , then to hurl them on an astonish world .
they would go bob like stone start down a long hill , awakening an avalanche of admiration .
but no idea came to he .
<p>
he father have be a stolid English curate who write stout sermon which be actually publish , though very few ever buy them .
he mother write poetry which be a kind of summary of the sermon .
she verse be append to the volume of rugged orthodoxy .
And both he father and mother have idea .
both be creator in a small way .
<p>
James flower bad be rear in an atmosphere of " I musth be walking to I publisher now , Helen ! "
<p>
 " but William , a glorious thing burst upon I this morning as I be doing I hair-such a conception !
It musth surely have come from God .
It will be done in couplet I think .
oh ! glorious !
And it just fit in with those delightful word of yours on humility . "
<p>
 " ah , well ; I musth be walking to I publisher now , to see how the sermon be going .
I send a copy to the archbishop , and he may have be talk about them .
such a thing would start a great sale I think . "
<p>
yes , they be people with idea , and often they shake they heads over they dull son .
he have hold them in awe , have be frighten at they greatness and ashamed of she .
And so , early in he life , he have make a determination to have idea .
he reading have be tremendous .
kingbolt James " defence of witchcraft " came into he hands , and he set about to prove it true .
with the aid of ancient incantation and a black lotion which contain a number of filthy ingredient together with a large amount of hashish , he attempt to fly from the roof of he house .
It be while he two break leg be heal that he came on Scot " Discoverie of witchcraft . "
<p>
the system of Descartes be cause a stir amongst learned man , and James flower , too , determined to reduce all philosophy to a basic postulate .
he lay out paper and a number of fine pen at he side , but he could never come on he postulate .
 " I think , therefore I be , " he say ; " at least , I think I be . "
but this lead in a circle and get he nowhere .
then he join the new-found school of bacon .
with persistent experiment he burned he finger , and try to cross clover with barley , and pull the leg from numberless insect , strive to discover something-almost anything ; but he never do .
As he have a moderate income from money left he by an uncle , he experiment be varied and extensive .
<p>
A separatist of fanatic intensity have write a violent book of the good scientific manner effects of alcoholic spirit , momentary and perpetual .
this work fell into the hands of James flower , and he set out one evening to verify some of it more fantastic theory .
in the midst of he investigation the spirit of induction left he , and , without cause or warning , he assault one of he majesty guardsman with a potted plant .
have he only known it , this be the one spontaneous idea of he life .
the matter be hush up by an archdeacon who be related to he mother .
James flower small fortune be invest in a plantation in Barbados , and he be send to live there .
clearly , he do not fit in with orthodoxy and pentameter .
<p>
And so he have grown wistfully old , on the island .
he library be the fine in the Indies , and , as far as information go , he be the most learned man anywhere about .
but he learning form no design of the whole .
he have learned without absorbing , remember without assimilate .
he mind be a sad mass of unrelated facts and theory .
in he brain , as on he shelve , Caesar commentary stand shoulder to shoulder with Democritus and a treatise on spontaneous generation .
James flower , who have cry to be a creator , become a quiet , kindly little gentleman , somewhat ineffectual and very inefficient .
in he later year he have begin to mistake conviction for idea .
if a man stated any belief loudly enough he frighten James flower , for , he say to she , " here be one of those divinely endow creature who control the fire I lack altogether . "
<p>
1 . 2 . 4 IV
there be few white man on the great green plantation , and those who do grub there be sullen , tatter wretch , serving for some forget felony against the crown .
within they body the fever lay like a light sleeper who wake and snarl , then sleep again with one malicious eye unclose .
they knead the soil in the field with they finger , and as they year of servitude crawl on they eyes deaden , they shoulder slump , and a tire , dull imbecility stretch cloy web in they brain .
they language be a bastard argot of London , with a few word from the Guinea Negro and a few clatter Carib phrase .
when these man be loose from they slavery , they wander listlessly about for a time , and watch the other go to work with something of longing .
then , after a little , they either sign new paper of indenture , or go maraud like tiger from a break cage .
<p>
the overseer have be one of them , and now that he command those who have be he fellow , he inflict suffering in memory of he own pain .
<p>
James flower bring Henry to the shore , and something in the boy silent misery touched the planter .
he have never be able to think of he slave as man before .
he have blindly follow the injunction of the shrewd elder Cato in deal with he slave .
but here be one who be very obviously a human , and possibly a gentleman .
this boy have cry that he do want to be a slave .
the other always landed knowing they lot , and display a sullen rancour which musth be beat out of them on the cross .
<p>
 " do not be so hurt , child , " the planter say .
 " you be very young to be coming to the island .
in a few year you will be a man , and strong . "
<p>
 " but it be on I to be a buccaneer , " say Henry dully .
 " I came out to the sea to make I fortune and a name .
And how can I do these thing if I be a slave toil in the field ? "
<p>
 " I do not intend that you shall toil in the field .
I want you-I want a boy to be about the house now I be grow old .
I want a-a kind of companion who would talk with I and hear I talk .
the other planter come to the house and drink I wine , but when they leave I think they laugh at I and laugh at I book-I lovely book .
And so you will sit with I in the evenings , perhaps , and we will talk of the thing in book .
you father be a gentleman , I think .
you have the look .
<p>
 " now , today , " James flower go on mildly , " we have a hanging , and you and I musth hurry to be there .
I do just know what the fellow do , but it be enough .
And what say-oh ! what's he name ?
I have read it , anyway chief value of violent punishment lie with those on who the same might fall . '
yes , I think it be well to have some one hang every now and then .
It be expensive , but very conducive to good behaviour amongst the rest .
but I overseer attend to all that .
do you know , I think he really enjoy ii . "
<p>
he lead the boy to a square of thatch mud hut , build close together , each with it door opening out into a kind of plaza .
And in the center of the square , like a horrible fetish , rose a tall gallows make of black wood and polished with oil until it shine dully in the sunlight .
It be so place that no slave could look out of he hovel without seeing the black horror that might be he end .
this be the overseer work .
with he own hands he have rub the dark wood until it glow .
he be accustomed to stand and gaze at it , head cock to one side , as an artist might look at he new finished work .
<p>
the planter and the boy seat she .
the slave be herd into the square .
And Henry saw a naked black figure squirm and writhe at the end of a rope while the Negro rock she back and forth on the ground and moan ; while the white slave grit they tooth and cursed harshly to keep from shriek .
the Caribs squat on they ham and watch with no particular interest and no fear .
thus they might squat and watch the fire which cook they food .
<p>
when it be all over , and the black victim hang limply by he crooked neck , the planter look down and saw that Henry be crying nervously .
<p>
 " I know it be bad the first time , " lie say gently " when I first saw it , I do not sleep for a good while .
but after a little , when you have see five ten-a dozen-go out in this way , you will come to have no feeling about it , and no more think of it than of a chicken flop about with a wring neck . "
<p>
Henry breath still came in little miserable choke .
<p>
 " I can show you in the works of Holmaron on the practice of the inquisition , a dissertation on this very thing you feel .
'The first time one see human suffering , ' he say , 'it be an unnatural thing , because , within one experience , placid , comfortable people be the rule .
but , after a number of such experience , the sight of torture become a normal thing , and normal humans come to relish it to various extent . '
remind I to show you the passage sometime ; though I musth say I have never come to relish the matter . "
<p>
in the evenings of the month that came , the two of them sit in the black depth of the veranda , and James flower pour he unrelated facts into the ear of young Henry Morgan .
the boy listen eagerly , for often the planter spoke of ancient war and they conduct .
<p>
 " And be these thing in the book that line the wall ? " Henry ask one night .
<p>
 " all of these thing , and , oh ! many thousand of thing more . "
<p>
after a time Henry beg , " would you be teaching I the language of the book , sir ?
there musth be thing there I should like to read for she . "
<p>
James flower be delighted .
in teaching this boy the thing he have read , he have come near to satisfaction than ever before .
he heart be warm toward the young slave .
<p>
 " the Latin and the Greek ! " he cry with enthusiasm .
 " you shall learn them from I ; and the Hebrew , too , if you wish . "
<p>
 " I want to read the book of war and sailing , " young Henry say .
 " I want to read of those old war you speak of , for one day I shall be a buccaneer and take a Spanish town . "
<p>
And in the month that follow , he learned the language very rapidly because of he wish to read the book .
James flower plunge more deeply into he volume than ever , for he new role of teacher be very dear experience to he .
<p>
after a little while , he would say , " Henry , will you tell the overseer to gather the molasses on the beach ?
A ship be in to buy it . "
And later still , " Henry , be there anything I should be doing today ? "
<p>
 " well sir , there's a great ship down there , in from the Netherlands .
we be in strong need of sickle .
the Caribs have steal nearly all the old one to make sword with .
we shall have trouble with those Caribs one day , sir . "
<p>
 " well , see to the sickle , will you , Henry ?
I hate to be moving in this sun .
And have the Indian punish if they steal thing .
attend to that , too , will you ? "
<p>
little by little , Henry be absorbing the management of the plantation .
<p>
one evening , after Henry have be there a year , he gain the paramount respect of James flower ; rather a wistful respect , though he lose no love by it .
<p>
 " have you considered these ancient war ? " Henry ask .
 " I have be reading of Alexander and Xenophon and Caesar in they war .
And the think be on I that battle and tactics-that be , successful tactics-be nothing more than a glorify trickery .
the force be necessary , and the arms , of course ; but the war be really win by the man who sit back , like one cheat at card , and confound the enemy with he trickery .
have you considered that , sir ?
any one who can guess the mind of ordinary general , as I can guess the mind of the slave , can win battle .
such a man would have only to shun what be expect of he .
be that the secret of tactics , sir ? "
<p>
 " I have not think of it , " say James flower just a trifle jealously .
And that awe he feel for people of idea go out to Henry .
but the planter take great comfort in telling she that , after all , he be the teacher who have awaken these idea .
<p>
two year after Henry have come , the overseer be release by the year from he bondage .
he found he freedom too strong a drug for the mind that have be used to outside control .
that mind snap , and fury flood in on he , so that he go shout along the road , striking at every passer-by .
And in the night he mania become a terrible , frantic thing .
he roll on the ground under he gallows , and bloody foam froth from he mouth while the slave look on in terror .
at length he arise , with ragged hair and maniac , flaming eyes .
he seize a torch and rush into the field .
And Henry Morgan shot he dead as he enter the close grow row of cane .
<p>
 " who know the work as well as I do , and who can you trust more , sir ? " young Henry ask the planter .
 " I have learned thing in the book and from I watch that will make this plantation a hundred time more productive . "
<p>
thus he become much more than the overseer .
<p>
Henry removed the gallows from the square , and after that the hanging be done secretly , in the night .
this be not kindness .
he know , out of he own reasoning , that the unknown thing can never become the normal thing ; that unseen punishment could be far more horrible to the remain slave than those see under the light of the sun .
<p>
Henry have learned many thing in deal with the slave .
he know that he musth never let them see what he be thinking , for then , in some ineffable way , they have a hold on he which would be difficult to shake off .
he musth be cold and distant and insult to those below he .
with few exception , they would take insult as the sign of he superiority .
man always believe he what he seem to be , and he could seem to be almost anything .
<p>
if one be brilliantly dress , all man presume he rich and powerful , and treat he accordingly .
when he say thing as though he mean them , nearly all act as though he mean them .
And , most important of he lesson-if he be perfectly honest and give a strict accounting in nine consecutive dealings , then the tenth time he might steal as much as he wish , and no one would dream of suspect he , so only he have bring the nine time forcibly enough to the attention of all man .
<p>
A grow pile of golden coin in a box under he bed give ample proof of the validity of this last lesson .
And he follow all he teaching .
he never give any man the least hold on he , nor insight into he motive and means and ability and short-coming .
since most man do not believe in she , they could not believe in one they understand to be like she .
<p>
these rule he glean gradually from he life , until he be master of the plantation , until James flower pitifully lean on he advice and he conviction , and until the Caribs and black and felon white man hate and fear he , and yet could make no dent in he be-could get no hold to hurt he .
<p>
James flower be deliciously happy-happy than he have ever be-for this boy have lift the hideous weight of the plantation from he shoulder .
he need think no more of the matter of till the soil .
more and more he lay drown in he book .
And , now he be coming to be an old man , he read the same book over and over again without knowing it .
often he feel a slight irritation at the careless person who have make notes in he margin and dog eared the page .
<p>
And Henry Morgan have get she a great plantation and a great power .
under he captaincy the earth flowered and increase .
he be making the land give four time as much as it have before .
the slave worked deliriously under the whips which follow them to the field , but there be nothing personal in the whips .
the old overseer have delighted in punishment , but Henry Morgan be not cruel .
he be merciless .
he merely speed the wheels of he factory .
one could not think of be kind to a sprocket or a fly-wheel , and no more could this boy think of pamper he slave .
<p>
Henry be force money out of the ground , and from it be add to he hoard in the box under he bed-a little from the season sale of cane and a trifle in the buy of new cattle .
It be not steal , but only a kind of commission for he success .
the little pile of golden coin grow and grow for the time when Henry Morgan should go a and take a Spanish town .
<p>
1 . 2 . 5 V
Henry have serve three year , and , though he be only eighteen , he be grown and strong .
he crisp black hair seem to curl more tightly to he head , and he mouth , from deal with the slave , be more firm than ever .
he gaze about he and know that he should be satisfy , but he eyes have never lose the trick of look out beyond distance and over the edge of the present .
A little hector wish run through he wake and dream like a thin red line .
he musth get back to the sea and ship .
the sea be he mother and he mistress , and the goddess who might command and find he ready and alert for service .
why , he very name , in the ancient Briton tongue , signify one who live by the sea .
yes , the ship be calling to he cruelly now .
he heart sail out , away from he with every passing merchantman .
<p>
in the big house he have studied and considered what navigation there be in book , and in the plantation little sloop he have go cruise in the near water .
but this be the play of a child , he think , and it be not prepare he to be an expert sailor .
It be necessary for he to learn avidly , for in the near future he musth go a and take a Spanish town .
this be the silver throne of all he desire .
<p>
And so , one evening " there be a thing I should like to be speaking of , sir . "
<p>
James flower raise he eyes from he book and lay he head back in the chair .
<p>
 " if we have a ship to carry we produce to Jamaica , " Henry continue , " we should be saving a large deal in freightage .
the cost of such a ship would soon enough be eat away by the profit .
too , we might carry the produce of the other plantation at a small fee than the merchantman ask . "
<p>
 " but where might one come on such a ship ? " James flower inquired .
<p>
 " there be one in the harbour now , one of two mast and "
 " then buy she ; buy she , and see to it .
you know more about these thing than I do .
by the way , here be an interesting conjecture on the inhabitant of the moon .
'They may be totally unlike human being , ' he read .
'Their neck could easily be "
 " It will be seven hundred pound , sir . "
<p>
 " what will be seven hundred pound ?
you seem not to pay attention as you used , Henry .
do listen to this paragraph ; it be both entertaining and instructive "
Henry careen the ship , and when he have scrape and paint she , he name she Elizabeth and put to sea .
he have what be known as " hands " to a horseman , a warm feeling of the personality of he boat .
he musth learn the rule of navigation , of course ; but even before that something of the spirit of the ship creep into he soul , and part of he go back to she .
It be a steadfast love , a steady understanding of the sea .
by the thrill of she deck and the smooth touch of the wheel , he know instinctively how close he could bring she into the wind .
he be like a man who , lay he head on he mistress breast , read the flux of she passion in she breathing .
<p>
now he could have run away from Barbados and go to plunder in the stanch Elizabeth , but there be no need .
he hoard be not great enough and he be too young ; and in addition , he feel a curious , shame-face love for James flower .
<p>
Henry be content for a little while .
the lust that all man have in vary degree-some for the flash of card , and some for wine , and some for the body of woman-be in Henry Morgan , satisfy with the deck lunge and pitch and the crack of canvas .
the wind , blow out of a black , dreadful sky , be a cup of wine to he , and a challenge , and a passionate caress .
<p>
he sail to Jamaica with the crop and beat about amongst the island .
the return from the plantation mounted , and Henry box of coin be grow heavy .
<p>
but after a few month , a dull , torture desire came to he .
It be the yearning of the little boy , revivify and strong .
the Elizabeth have sate he old lust and left a new one .
he think it be plunder that call he : the beautiful thing of silk and gold and the admiration of man , and on these he heart set more zealously than ever .
<p>
Henry go to the brown woman and the black in the slave hut , strive to dull he hunger if he could not satisfy it ; and they receive he , cow eyed and passive , anxious to please .
they hope that of he favour they might receive more food or a jug of rummy as a gift .
each time , he came away with disgust and a little pity for they poor , hopeful prostitution .
<p>
once , in the slave dock at Port royal , he found Paulette and buy she for a servant in the house .
she be lithe , yet rounded ; fierce and gentle in a moment .
poor little slave of the jumble blood , she be Spanish and Carib and Negro and French .
the heritage of this rag-bag ancestry be hair like a cataract of black water , eyes as blue as the sea , set in oriental slit , and a golden , golden skin .
hers be a sensuous , passionate beauty-limb that twinkle like golden flame .
she lip could writhe like slender , twist serpent or bloom like red flower .
she be a little child , yet old in life .
she be a Christian , but she worship wood spirit and sing low chant in honour of the great snake .
<p>
Henry think of she as a delicate machine perfectly make for pleasure , a sexual contraption .
she be like those tall , cool woman of the night who ride with the wing of sleep-soulless body-body of passionate dream .
he build for she a tiny , vine-clad house roof with banana leave and there he play at love .
<p>
at first Paulette be only grateful to he for bring she to a lazy , easy life , with comfort and days of little toil , but later she fell frenziedly in love with he .
she watch he face like a quick terrier , wait to jump with wild pleasure at one word or fall fawn in the dust at another .
<p>
when Henry be serious or distraught , she be afraid ; then she would kneel before she little ebony figure of a jungle god and pray to the virgin for he love .
sometimes she put out cup of milk for the wing Jun-Jo which keep man true .
with the frantic , tender arts of she mixed blood , she strive to hold he surely in she sight .
from she body and she hair there came a rich orient odour , for she rub she with sandalwood and myrrh .
<p>
when he be gloomy " do you love Paulette ? " she would ask .
 " do you love Paulette ?
be you sure you love Paulette ? "
<p>
 " why , certainly , I love Paulette .
how could a man see Paulette , little dear Paulette-how touch the lip of sweet Paulette-and not be loving she ? "
And he eyes would go wandering to the sea below , seek and seek along the curve shore .
<p>
 " but do you surely , surely love Paulette ?
come , kiss the little breast of you own Paulette . "
<p>
 " yes , surely I love Paulette .
there !
I have kiss them and the charm be make .
now do be still a little .
hear the pound of the frog .
I wonder what startle the old bearded monkey in the tree there ; some slave , perhaps , out steal fruit . "
And he eyes would go wandering restlessly to sea .
<p>
As the year go on , the soil of she love thrust up strong vine of choke fear .
she know that when he finally desert she she would be far more than just alone .
she might be forced to kneel in the field row and dig about the plant with she finger as the other woman do .
And then , one day , she would be lead to the hut of a great Negro with powerful muscle , and he would bruise she little golden body in he beast clutch and make she pregnant of a black child-a strong , black child that could toil and strain in the sun when it be grown .
this happen to all the other slave woman of the island .
the half of she mind that be very old shudder at this think , and that same old mind know well that Henry would leave she one day .
<p>
then , to she child mind , appear the doorway for the passage of she fright .
if only he would marry she-impossible it seem , yet stranger thing have be-if only he would marry she , then she need never fear .
for those strange being , wive , be , in some curious way , by some divine intent , shield from ugly and uncomfortable thing .
ah ! she have see them in Port royal , surround by they man to keep foul contact off , breathing through scent cloth to deaden the vile smell , and sometimes with little pellet of cotton in they ear to stop the curse of the street from enter .
And Paulette know-have she not be tell ? -that in they home they lay in great , soft bed , and languidly give order to they slave .
<p>
this be the blessed state she dare to hope for .
And she body be not enough , she know .
often it fail in it soft potency .
if she feed he full of love , he do not come again to she bower for a time ; and when she refuse he to make he passion mount , either he go sullenly away or laugh and fling she roughly on the low , palm couch .
she musth cast about for some compelling force , some very powerful means to make he marry she .
<p>
when Henry go away with cocoa for Port royal , she be scarcely sane .
she know he love for the ship , he passion for the sea , and she be furiously jealous of them .
in she mind she saw he fondle the wheel with the strong , dear touch of lover finger .
ah ! she could scratch and tear that wheel which rob she .
<p>
she musth make he love Paulette more than the ship , more than the sea , or anything on earth , so that he would marry she .
then she could walk haughtily amongst the hut and spit at the slave ; then she need never think of grub in the earth or bearing strong black child ; then she would have red cloth to wear , and a silver chain to go about she neck .
It be even possible that once in a long while she dinner might be bring to she while she lay in bed , pretend to be ill .
she wriggle she toe in delight at such a think , and make up the insult thing she would say to one fat Negress with a spiteful tongue , when only she should be a wife .
that old , fat wretch have call Paulette a slut before a gathering .
Paulette have pull out lots of hair before she could be hold with she arms to she side-but still , that black one should see , one day .
Paulette would have she whip on the cross .
<p>
while Henry be away a trade ship came into port , and Paulette go to the beach to see the thing she bring and to watch the wind-brown sailor come ashore .
And one of them , a great , broad Irishman , lade with black rummy , pursue and capture she against a pile of box .
strong and quick , she struggle to elude he , but he hold she tightly , sway though he be .
<p>
 " I've catch a fairy to mend I shoe , " he laugh , and peer into she face .
 " sure enough , 'tis a fairy . "
And then he saw that she be small and very beautiful , and he spoke tenderly and low .
<p>
 " You're a lovely fairy-lovely than the eyes of I have ever see .
could a slim little body like you be thinking anything about a great , ugly hulk like I , I wonder ?
come off and marry I , and you shall have anything 'tis in the power of a sailor to give you . "
<p>
 " No ! " she cry .
 " No ! " and slip under he arm and away .
the sailor sit in the sand stare dully before he .
<p>
 " 'Twas a dream , " he whisper ; " 'twas only a dream from the spirit .
There's no such thing to be happening to a poor sailor .
No ; for sailor there be pretty hag with sharp , hard eyes to say , 'Come ! money first , sweetheart mine . ' "
but now Paulette have found the way to make Henry many she .
she would contrive to get drunkenness on he , would traprock he with wine , and there would be a priest nearby to come at she hush call .
oh , surely , stranger thing have be !
<p>
she lay she snare for he on he first night back from sea-a large stone flagon fill with Peruvian wine , and a priest , bribe with a steal coin , wait in the shadow of a tree .
Henry be very tire .
he have go out short-handed and help to work the ship she .
the little vine-clothe hut be a pleasant , restful place to he .
A full white moon cast silver splash in the sea below and strew the ground with scarves of purple light .
sweetly there sing a little jungle breeze amongst the palm .
<p>
she bring the wine and fill a cup for he .
 " do you love Paulette ? "
<p>
 " ah , yes ! as God see I , I love Paulette ; dear , sweet Paulette . "
another cup , and still , persistently " be you so sure you love Paulette ? "
<p>
 " Paulette be a little star hanging to I breast by a silver chain . "
<p>
another cup .
<p>
 " do you love none other save only you Paulette ? "
<p>
 " I came longingly to find Paulette ; the think of she sail on the sea with I . "
And he arms lock tightly around she little golden waist .
<p>
another and another and another ; then he arms fell away from she and he hands clench .
the girl cry fearfully , " oh ! do you love Paulette ? " for Henry have grown morose and strange and cold .
<p>
 " I shall tell you of an old time , " he say hoarsely .
 " I be a little boy , a joyous little boy , yet old enough to love .
there be a girl-and she be name Elizabeth-the daughter of a wealthy squire .
ah ! she be lovely as this night about we , quiet and lovely as that slender palm tree under the moon .
I love she with that love a man may exercise but once .
even we hearts seem to go hand in hand .
how I remember the brave plan we tell she and I , there , sitting on a hillside in the night .
we be to live in a great house and have dear child grow up about we .
you can never know such love , Paulette .
<p>
 " ah , well !
It could not last .
the god slay happiness in jealousy .
nothing good can last .
A gangue of bastard sailor roved through the land and carry I off-a little boy to be sell for a slave in the Indies .
It be a bitter thing to lose Elizabeth-a bitter thing the year can forget . "
And he be weeping softly by she side .
<p>
Paulette be bewilder by the change in he .
she stroke he hair and he eyes , until he breath came more calmly .
then she begin again , with almost helpless patience , like a teacher questioning a dull child .
<p>
 " But-do you love Paulette ? "
<p>
he leap up and glare at she .
<p>
 " you ?
love you ?
why , you be just a little animal ! a pretty little golden animal , for sure , but a forme of flesh no more .
May one worship a god merely because he be big , or cherish a land which have no virtue save it breadth , or love a woman who whole realm be she flesh ?
ah , Paulette ! you have no soul at all !
Elizabeth have a white wing soul .
I love you-yes-with what you have to be love-the body .
but Elizabeth-I love Elizabeth with I soul . "
<p>
Paulette be puzzle .
<p>
 " what be this soul ? " she ask .
 " And how may I get one if I have not one already ?
And where be this soul of yours that I have never see it or hear it at all ?
And if they can be see , or hear , or touched , how do you know she have this soul ? "
<p>
 " hush ! " he cry furiously .
 " hush ! or I box you mouth and have you whip on the cross .
you speak of thing beyond you .
what can you know of love that lie without you fleshly juggle ? "
<p>
1 . 2 . 6 VI
Christmas came to the hot tropic , the fourth Christmas of Henry servitude .
And James flower bring he a small box done up with colored string .
<p>
 " It be a gift of the season , " he say , and he eyes sparkle with delight while Henry untie the package .
there be a little teakwood box , and in it , lie on the scarlet silk of it lining , the tear fragment of he slavery .
Henry take the shred of paper from the box and stare at them , and then he laugh unsteadily and put he head down on he hands .
<p>
 " now you be no longer a servant , but I son , " the planter say .
 " now you be I son , who I have teach strange knowledge-and I shall teach you more , far more .
we will live here always and talk together in the evenings . "
<p>
Henry raise he head .
<p>
 " oh ! but I can , can stay .
I musth be off a . "
<p>
 " You-you can stay ?
but , Henry , I have plan we life .
you would not leave I here alone . "
<p>
 " sir , " say Henry , " I musth be off a .
why , in all I year it have be the one aim .
I musth go , sir . "
<p>
 " but , Henry , dear Henry , you shall have half I plantation , and all of it when I be dead-if only you will stay with I . "
<p>
 " that may not be , " young Henry cry .
 " I musth be off to make I a name .
It be not give that I live a planter .
sir , there be plannings in I head that have grown perfect with ponder .
And nothing may be allow to interfere with them . "
<p>
James flower slump forward in he chair .
<p>
 " It will be very lonely here without you .
I do quite know what I shall do without you . "
<p>
Henry mind carry he back to that old time , with Robert smile into the fire and saying these same word " It will be so lonely here without you , son . "
he wonder if he mother still sit coldly upright and silent .
surely she would have get over it .
people always get over the thing they fear so much .
And then he think of small Paulette who would be crying with terror in she hut when he tell she .
<p>
 " there be a little servant girl , " he say ; " little Paulette .
I have protect she .
And if I have ever please you , will you do these thing for I ?
always , always keep she in the house and never let she be send to the field , nor whip , nor breed with any of the black .
Will you do these thing for I surely ? "
<p>
 " of course I will , " James flower say .
 " ah , but it have be good to have you here , Henry-good to hear you voice in the evening .
what will I do in the evening now ?
there be none to take you place , for you have very truly be I son .
It will be lonely here without you , boy . "
<p>
say Henry , " the toil I have done in you service have be more than repay with the knowledge you have pour into I ear these same evenings .
And I shall miss you , sir , more than I can say .
but can you understand ?
I musth go a and take a Spanish town , for the think be on I that if a man plan carefully , and considered he chance and the man he have , the thing might well be done .
I have studied the ancient war , and I musth be making a name for she and a fortune .
then , when I have the admiration of man , perhaps I shall come back to you , sir , and we may sit and talk again in the evenings .
you will remember I wish about Paulette ? "
<p>
 " who be Paulette ? " the planter ask .
<p>
 " why , the servant girl I mention .
never let she go with the slave , because I be fond of she . "
<p>
 " ah , yes !
I remember !
And where do you go now , Henry ? "
<p>
 " to Jamaica .
I uncle , sir Edward , have long be Lieutenant there in Port royal .
but I have never see he-well , because I be a bond servant , and he be a gentleman .
I have a letter to he that I father give I year past .
perhaps he will help I to buy a ship for I plunder . "
<p>
 " I would help you buy a ship .
you have be very good to I , " the planter say hopefully .
<p>
now Henry be dip in a kind of shame , for in the box under he bed there glisten a pile of golden coin-over a thousand pound .
<p>
 " No , " he say , " no ; I have more payment in you teaching and in the father you have be to I than money could ever equal . "
now he be going , Henry know that he have grown to love this red-faced , wistful man .
<p>
strong , glisten black pull at the oar of the canoe , and it go skim toward an anchor ship , a ship commissioned by the States-General to carry black slave from Guinea to the island .
James flower , sitting in the canoe stern , be very red and very silent .
but as they near the ship side , he lift up he head and spoke pleadingly to Henry .
<p>
 " there be book on the shelve that you have never read . "
<p>
 " I shall come back , one day , and read them . "
<p>
 " there be thing in I mind I have never tell you , boy . "
<p>
 " when I have the admiration of man , I shall come to you and you shall tell them to I . "
<p>
 " you swear it ? "
<p>
 " Well-yes , I swear . "
<p>
 " And how long will it take you to do these thing , Henry ? "
<p>
 " I can tell ; one year-or ten-or twenty .
I musth make a very admirable name . "
Henry be climbing over the ship side .
<p>
 " I shall be lonely in the evenings , son . "
<p>
 " And I , too , sir .
look ! we cast off !
Good-by , sir .
you will remember Paulette ? "
<p>
 " Paulette ?
-Paulette ?
-Ah , yes ; I remember . "
<p>
1 . 2 . 7 VII
Henry Morgan came to the English town of Port royal and left he baggage on the beach while he go look for he uncle .
<p>
 " do you know where I may find the Lieutenant ? " he ask in the street .
<p>
 " he palace be yonder , young man , and who know he may be in it . "
<p>
he Palace-it be like a British gentleman become an official far from home .
It be like the man Robert Morgan have describe .
he letters dated from the palace of the Lieutenant .
Henry found the palace , a low grubby house with wall of whitewash mud and a roof of red tile badly mould .
there be a gaudy halberdier standing at the door , holding he great , ineffectual weapon rigidly before he , the while he maintain a torture decorum in the face of a swarm of enemy fly .
<p>
the halberd lower across the pathway as Henry approach .
<p>
 " I be look for sir Edward Morgan . "
<p>
 " what do you wish with he Excellency ? "
<p>
 " why , you see , sir , he be I uncle , and I wish to speak with he . "
<p>
the soldier scowl suspiciously and stiffen he hold on the halberd .
then Henry remember he lesson of the plantation .
perhaps this man , for all he red coat , might be something of a slave .
<p>
 " get out of I way , you damned pup , " he cry .
 " get out of I way or I'll see you hang . "
<p>
the man cower and almost drop he weapon .
 " yes , sir .
I'll scend you word , sir . "
he blow a little silver call , and when a servant in green lace came to the door , he say : " A young gentleman to see he Excellency . "
<p>
Henry be lead into a little room make dark with thick , grey hanging edge with dull gold .
there be three dim portrait on the wall , in black frame ; two cavaliers in plume bat , holding they sword horizontally so they look like stiff , slender tails , and a pretty lady with powder hair and a silken gown which left she shoulder and half she breast uncovered .
<p>
from some place beyond the curtain doorway there came the thin twang of a harp slow strike .
the servant take Henry letter and left he alone .
<p>
And he feel very much alone .
It be a house of cold , precise hair splitting .
one be aware of a polite contempt even in the picture face on the wall .
the British arms be embroider on the curtains of the door , the lion on one side , holding half the shield , and the unicorn , with he half , on the other .
when the curtains hang straight the design be complete .
in this room , Henry begin to fear he uncle .
<p>
but all these thought of he be shock from he brain when sir Edward appear .
It be he father as he remember he , and yet never he father .
Old Robert would never have have a moustache like an eyelash , and nothing in Robert life could have make he pinch he lip together until they be as thin as the moustache .
these two might have be born alike as bean , but each have create he own mouth .
<p>
Robert have speak truth ; this man be he strut counterpart .
but sir Edward be like an actor , who , though cast in a ridiculous role , yet make he part seem the correct thing and all other absurd .
he purple coat with lace at the neck and wrist , the long rapier , lean as a pencil in a scabbard of grey silk , the grey silk stocking and soft grey shoe with bow ribbon on them , seem to Henry the high type of proper wear .
he own good clothing be shabby by comparison .
<p>
he uncle have be look at he steadily , wait for Henry to speak first .
<p>
 " I be Henry Morgan , sir-Robert son , " he begin simply .
<p>
 " I see you be .
there be a resemblance-a faint likeness .
And what may I do for you ? "
<p>
 " why , I-I do know .
I came to call on you and inform you of I existence . "
<p>
 " that be kind of you-ah-very kind . "
<p>
It be difficult to broach speech into this field of almost sneering courtesy .
Henry ask , " have you hear any single thing of I parent in the long five year I have be out ? "
<p>
 " five year !
what have you be doing , pray ? "
<p>
 " I be a bond-servant , sir .
but of I parent ? "
<p>
 " you mother be dead . "
<p>
 " I mother be dead , " Henry repeated in a whisper .
he wonder if she have die soon after he have go .
he do not feel very badly about it , and yet the word sound such tremendous thing , such final thing .
this be the end of something that might never be again .
 " I mother be dead , " he murmur .
 " And I father ? "
<p>
 " I have hear that you father do peculiar thing in he rose garden .
squire Rhys write I of it .
he pluck the full flower and cast them into the air like one amaze .
the ground be cover with petal and the neighbour stand about and laugh at he .
Robert be never normal ; indeed , he be never quite sane , or he might have go far with James I . I , for one , always think he would come to some disgrace or other .
he revere nothing worthy of reverence .
why musth he do this thing in the open , with the people jeer ?
It bring ridicule on his-ah-relative . "
<p>
 " And do you think he be really insane , uncle ? "
<p>
 " I do not know , " sir Edward say , and add with a touch of impatience , " I merely quoted squire Rhys' letter .
I position do not allow I time for vain conjecture-nor much time for idle conversation , " he say pointedly .
<p>
the methodical twang of the harp have cease , and now the curtain of the door be thrust aside and a slender girl enter the room .
It be difficult to see she in this dark place .
It be plain she be not beautiful , but rather proudly pretty .
she be softly dress and she face be pale .
even she hair be pale fragile gold .
altogether she seem a wan , tire echo of sir Edward .
<p>
the girl be startle at seeing Henry there , and he found that he be a little afraid of she in the same manner that he be grow to fear sir Edward .
she look at Henry as though he be some distasteful food which only the strict rule of courtesy prevent she from pushing away from she place .
<p>
 " you cousin Henry , " sir Edward say shortly ; and , " I motherless daughter , Elizabeth . "
then , nervously , as though no good could possibly come of this contact , " Hadn't you good practice you music a little longer , I dear ? "
<p>
she drop a suggestion of a curtsy to Henry , and in a voice like she father , greet he .
<p>
 " how d'ye do .
yes , sir , I think I have good practice .
that last piece be difficult but beautiful . "
And she disappear behind the curtain whence came again the slow , accurate striking of the harp .
<p>
Henry grip he resolve , though he be afraid of this man .
<p>
 " there be a thing I wish to speak of , sir .
I want to go a , Uncle-on the sea , in a great ship with gun .
And when I have take prise , and a cloud of man gather to I reputation , then I would be capture a Spanish town for plunder and ransom .
I be a good sailor , I uncle .
I can navigate in any sea , I think ; and I have it in I to plan carefully I campaign .
I have read a great lot on the ancient war .
the buccaneer have never be the force I mean to make them .
why , I could forme army and navy of them , I dear uncle .
in time I would lead the whole free brotherhood of the coast , and it would be an armed power to reckon with .
<p>
 " these thing I have considered in the long year of I slavery .
there be a crying in I heart to do these thing .
I think the end of all I dream be a great name and a great fortune .
I know I power .
I be twenty year old ; I have have several year at sea ; and I have a thousand pound .
the man who help I now-who go with I as partner-I will make rich .
I be so very sure I can do these thing-so very sure .
<p>
 " I ask you , I uncle , to add to I thousand pound enough so that I may buy a fitted ship and gather the free , brave spirit about I to do I will .
if you will place another thousand pound in I hands , I swear to make you rich than you be . "
<p>
the harp be no longer sounding .
at the beginning of the boy outburst , sir Edward have hold up he hand as though to stop he , but the word plunge on .
And when the harp have be silence , sir Edward look uneasily toward the door .
now he seem to bring he interest back to Henry .
<p>
 " I have no money to risk in unsure venture , " he say sharply .
 " And I have no more time for talk .
the governor be coming to consult with I in a moment .
but I would say that you be a wild , careless boy who be like to come to hanging of you venture .
you father be like you , only he be a wildness of the mind .
<p>
 " And I musth inform you that there be peace between Spain and England ; not very good feeling , it be true , but still , peace .
if you go maraud it will be I duty to see you punish , sorry for it though I may be .
the Roundhead be no longer in power and those wild thing that Cromwell overlook be carefully watch now .
remember what I say , for I would not like to hang I nephew .
now I musth really bid you good day . "
<p>
tears of resentment stand in Henry eyes .
<p>
 " thank you for coming to see I , " he uncle say .
 " Good-by . "
And he go through the curtain doorway .
<p>
in the street , Henry walk moodily along .
he saw he cousin a short distance ahead of he , a tall Negro attendant upon she .
he continue slowly that she might leave he behind , but the girl lag on she way .
<p>
 " perhaps she wish to speak with I , " Henry think , and quicken he step to come up with she .
he saw , incredulously , what the darken room have hide .
she be only a little girl , not more than fourteen at the most .
Elizabeth look up as he came beside she .
<p>
 " do you find interesting thing to be doing here in the Indies ? " Henry ask .
<p>
 " As many as one might expect , " she reply .
 " we have be here a good while , you know . "
And touching she slave arm with she little parasol , she turn into a crossing street , and left young Henry look after she .
<p>
he be bitter against these proud relative who seem to edge away from he as though he be foul .
he could not call them silly , for they have impress he too deeply .
they have succeed in making he feel alone and helpless and very young .
<p>
the narrow way of port royal be deep with muddy filth , ground to thick liquid by the cart and the numberless bare foot .
Port royal bore the same resemblance to a city as the palace of the Lieutenant do to Whitehall .
the street be only narrow alley line with dirty wooden house .
And each house have a balcony above the street where people sit and stare at Henry as he pass ; stare not with interest , but wearily , as man in sickness watch fly crawl on the ceiling .
<p>
one street seem to have no inhabitant save only woman-black woman , and white , and grey woman , with fever write on they hollow cheek .
they lean from they balcony like unclean siren and softly call as he go by .
then , when he pay no attention to them , they shriek like angry parrot and scream curse and spit after he .
<p>
near the waterfront he came to a kind of tavern with a great crowd gather in front of it .
standing in the center of the way be a cask of wine with it head stave in , and a big , drunken man in crazy lace and a plume hat strut beside it .
he pass out cup and basin and even hat full of wine to the reach man .
now and then he call for a toast and a cheer , and he crowd scream it acclaim .
<p>
young Henry seek to pass them in he misery .
<p>
 " come drink I health , young man . "
<p>
 " I do not wish to drink , " say Henry .
<p>
 " you do not wish to drink ? "
the big man be overwhelm with this new situation .
then he re-cover he wrath .
<p>
 " by God ! you will so drink when captain Dawes that take the supply ship Sangre de Cristo this day week ask you . "
the lower man came close , then suddenly draw a great pistol from he belt and pointed it waveringly at Henry breast .
<p>
the boy eyed the pistol .
<p>
 " I will drink you health , " he say .
And while he drink , an idea came to he .
 " let I speak to you alone , captain Dawes , sir , " and he tug the pirate into the tavern door .
 " about you next trip " he begin .
<p>
 " I next trip and hell ! " the captain roar .
 " I've just take a good prise , have I ?
I've get money , have I ?
then what be this you be squall about a next trip ?
wait till the prise be spend and the wound heal .
wait till I've drain Port royal dry of wine , and then come talk about the next trip . "
he rush back into the street crowd .
 " boy ! " he yell .
 " boy , you have not drunk I health for hours .
come , shout together now , and then we will sing ! "
<p>
Henry walk onward in despair .
in the harbour a number of ship be lie at anchor .
he approach a sailor sitting in the sand .
<p>
 " that one fast , " he say , to open the acquaintance .
<p>
 " aye , good enough . "
<p>
 " be there any buccaneer of note in this town ? " Henry ask .
<p>
 " none but that Dawes , and he's only a roaring mouse .
he take a little boat loaded with supply for Campeche , and you'd think it be Panama he bring home for the noise he make about it . "
<p>
 " but be there none other ? "
<p>
 " well , there's one they call Grippo .
but he take no prise unless they go unarmed .
afraid of he shadow , Grippo .
yes , he's in port with no prise , and drink black rummy on tick , I guess . "
<p>
 " which be he ship ? "
Henry ask .
<p>
 " why , there she be .
they call she Ganymede .
they tell that Grippo stole she in saint Malo when she crew be drunk .
he and nine other tumble the poor stiff wretch overside and make off with the ship for the Indies .
yes , she's a good craft , but Grippo be no master .
A wonder it be that he's not wreck she before now .
take Mansveldt ; there's a master for you-a real master .
but Mansveldt be in Tortuga . "
<p>
 " A good , swift sailor , " Henry observe ; " though she could carry more canvas without hurt .
how about she gun ? "
<p>
 " they say she's over armed if anything . "
<p>
And on that night , Henry found the buccaneer drink in a hovel on the beach .
the man be nearly black ; two fat wrinkle cut each cheek as though a silken cord be pull tight against the flesh until it disappear .
he eyes dart here and there like sentry before a camp of little fear .
<p>
 " be you one they call Grippo ? "
Henry ask .
<p>
 " I take no prise , " the man cry , start back .
 " I take no prise .
you have nothing to fasten on I for . "
once in saint Malo he have be accost thus , and afterward they have whip he on the cross until a hundred sag mouth open on he body and every one laugh blood .
Grippo have fear all semblance of authority since then .
<p>
 " who be you ? " he ask .
<p>
 " I think I be going to make you fortune , Grippo , " Henry say with assurance .
he know how to handle this man , for he be a counterpart of the many slave of the plantation-fearful , and perhaps greedy .
 " what would you do with five hundred English pound , Grippo ? "
<p>
the black man lick he lip and glance at the empty cup before he .
 " what musth I do for this money ? " he whisper .
<p>
 " you will sell I the captaincy of the Ganymede . "
<p>
now Grippo be wary .
<p>
 " the Ganymede be worth much more , " he say firmly .
 " but I do not want to buy the ship-only the captaincy .
look , Grippo !
I'll make this compact with you .
I will give you five hundred pound for a half interest in the Ganymede , and all of she command .
then we will put to sea .
I think I know how to win plunder if there be no interference in I company .
Grippo , I will give you a writing to this effect .
if I fail in one single undertaking in the Ganymede , then you shall have the whole ship back , and you shall keep the five hundred pound . "
<p>
Grippo still look into he empty cup , but suddenly he be fill with excitement .
<p>
 " give I money , " he cry out .
 " quick ! give I the money . "
Then " Oloto ! Oloto ! bring white wine-white wine-for the love of Christ . "
<p>
1 . 3 chapter III
there be many glitter reputation along the coast of Darien and amongst the green Caribbean island when Henry Morgan came to be a buccaneer .
in the wine shop of Tortuga be tales of a thousand fortune make and spend , of fine ship take and sunk , of gold and plate dump on the dock like wood .
<p>
the free brotherhood have grown to be a terrible thing since Pierre le grand and a little band of hunter slip out of the woods of Hispaniola and capture the Vice of the plate fleet from a canoe .
France and Britain and Holland have see in these island a good hermitage for they criminal , and for year they have unload worthless human freight on the Indies .
there be a time in those old nation when any one who could not give a good , virtuous account of she be cram into a ship and send off to be a bond-servant to any man who would pay a small sum for he .
And when they time be up , these people stole gun and warred on Spain .
It be not strange , for Spain be Catholic and rich , while Huguenot and Lutheran and church of England man be poor and out at heel .
they fight a holy war .
Spain have lock up the treasure of the world .
if poor , mine beggar could be reach a coin through the keyhole , who be the bad for it ?
who minded except Spain ?
surely England and France and Holland take little heed of it .
sometimes they provided the pirate with commission against Aragon and Castile , so that you might come on a man who , ten year before , have be send out in a prison ship , carry the style of " captain by the grace of the kingbolt . "
<p>
France have the good of she wayward child at heart , for she send out twelve hundred woman to Tortuga to be the wive of buccaneer .
the whole twelve hundred turn to a business more profitable than wifehood immediately they landed , but France could not help that .
<p>
they have get they name , these buccaneer , of a time when they be nothing more than cattle-hunter .
there be a way of smoke meat by burning small bit of fat and flesh in the fire .
this make the meat more savoury than usual .
It be call the boucan process , and from it the pirate be name .
<p>
but after a time these hunter came out of the woods in little , careful group ; then band form , and then whole fleet of eight or ten vessel .
And finally thousand assemble in Tortuga , and from that spot of safety buzz about the flank of Spain .
<p>
And Spain could not combat them .
do she hang ten , a hundred join they rank ; so she fortify she town and send she treasure on the sea under the protection of warship fill with soldier .
the numberless vessel of the Spanish colony be nearly all drive from the sea by the fierce buccaneer .
only once a year do the plate fleet sail out for home .
<p>
there be fine name amongst the brotherhood , and exploit to make Henry Morgan squirm with jealousy if he have not be so confident of overshadow them all one day .
<p>
Bartolomeo Portugues there be , who take a great prise .
but before he could get away with it , he be capture near Campeche .
the gibbet be erect on the shore for he hanging .
he watch them put it up from he prison aboard ship .
And in the night before he execution , he stab he guard and swim away , support by a keg .
before eight days have pass , he came again with pirate in a long canoe and stole the same ship away from the harbour of Campeche .
he lose she , of course , in a storm off Cuba , but the storey be , nevertheless , tell with glee in the tavern .
<p>
Roche Braziliano be a Hollander with a chubby face .
when he be young he be drive from Brazil by the Portuguese , and from they colony he have take he name .
curiously , he hold no rancour against Portugal .
he hatred turn on Spain .
he be a kindly , gentle , beloved captain , so only there be no Spaniard about .
he man worship he , and drink no other toast but to he name .
once , when he ship be wreck in Castilla de Oro , he kill most of a troop of Spanish horse and used they beast to ride off on .
when the man of Spain be near he , Roche be a foam beast .
It be tell that once he roast prisoner on green spit over a slow fire .
<p>
As the rich shipping be drive from the sea , the buccaneer musth be taking village , and then even town with fort .
Lewis Scot pillage Campeche and left it a black , smoke pile .
<p>
L'Ollonais have come from the sable d'Ollone , and very rapidly he become the most fear man in the western ocean .
he begin with a real hatred for Spain and end with a strong love of cruelty .
he have pull out tongues , and carve he prisoner to piece with he sword .
the Spanish man would far rather have meet the devil in any forme than L'Ollonais .
the whisper of he name empty the village in he path of every living unit .
It be say that the mouse flee to the jungle when he came .
Maracaibo he take , and New Gibraltar , and St . James de Leon .
everywhere he slaughter man for the fierce love of it .
<p>
once , when the blood lust be in he , he have command that eighty-seven prisoner be bound and lay in a row on the ground .
then he walk down the line , carry a whetstone in one hand and a long sword in the other .
that day he cut off eighty-seven heads with he own hand .
<p>
but L'Ollonais be not content with murder the Spanish man .
he go into the gentle country of Yucatan , where the people live in ruin stone city , and where the virgin go crown with flower .
they be a quiet people in Yucatan , and they race be dye in an inexplicable decay .
when L'Ollonais go away , the city be heap of stone and ashes , and there be no crown any more .
<p>
the Indian of Darien be different ; fierce , and fearless , and unrelenting .
the Spaniard call them bravo and swear that they be untamable .
they have be friend of the pirate because they so hate Spain , but L'Ollonais rob them and murder the tribesman .
these Indian wait many year for they vengeance , and at last they catch L'Ollonais when he ship have wreck on the shore of they country .
they build a fire and dance for hours , and then they burned the Frenchman body bit by bit before he eyes , a finger and a pinch of flesh at a time .
<p>
A lean French gentleman came into a tavern at Tortuga one night , and when they ask he name , seize a large rummy keg and hurl it from he .
<p>
 " bra de Fer , " he say , and no one ever question he farther .
It be never known whether he name be hide for a shame or a sorrow or a hatred , but all the coast came to know of he as a great , brave captain .
<p>
these be man who make phrase to be repeated .
<p>
 " No prey , no pay , " the Exterminator have bawl , and now every one be saying it .
when captain Lawrence , in a small boat , be assail by two Spanish frigate , he say to he man , " you have too much experience not to be sensible of you danger , and too much courage to fear it . "
this be a fine saying , and on the strength of it he follower capture the two Spanish ship and take them home to Goaves .
<p>
not all be cruel or even violent man .
some have a curious streak of piety .
there be captain Watling who make it a point to hold divine service every Sabbath , with the whole crew standing uncovered .
Daniel once shot a sailor for an irreverence .
these buccaneer pray loudly before battle , and , if they be successful , half of them troop off to a capture cathedral to sing the te Deum , while the other half plunder the prise .
<p>
captain of ship maintain the strict discipline amongst they man , swiftly punish insubordination or any other wrong-doing which might interfere with they success .
there be no such riot at sea as be later tolerate by Kidd and Blackbeard and Lafitte .
<p>
but out of the whole history of the brotherhood , one man towered .
there be a Dutchman name Edward Mansveldt .
in bravery and in soldiery he be pre-eminent , for he have take Granada and St . Augustine in Florida , and St . Catherine isle .
with a great fleet of ship he have go cruise along the coast of Darien and Castilla de Oro , taking what he might lay he hands on .
but there be a power of dream in he .
out of he mob of ragamuffin hero he want to make a strong , durable nation , a new , aggressive nation in America .
As more and more of the buccaneer flock to he command , he dream solidify .
he consult the government of England and France .
they be shock , and forbid he to consider such a thing .
A race of pirate not amenable to the gibbet of the crown ?
why , they would be plunder everybody .
he musth not be thinking about it at all .
<p>
but still he go on plan and plan he new government .
It would be start at St . Catherine isle .
he settle a body of he man there , and then go casting about for more to join he new nation .
he ship be wreck near the city of Havana , and Spaniard strangle Edward Mansveldt on the garotte .
<p>
these be the man Henry Morgan have set about to lead .
And , confidently , he saw no barrier , so only a man plan carefully and considered he chance .
these storey and these man be well enough , but they fell short in the large action .
they be improvident and vain .
they might help he one day .
<p>
Mansveldt be living and bra de Fer be an old man when Henry Morgan go sailing with black Grippo in the Ganymede .
<p>
1 . 3 . 1 I
there be excitement and curiosity in Port royal when Morgan be fitting out the Ganymede for sea .
strange stores and unusual weapon be going into she hold .
drawn on by the quiet confidence of this young man , many sailor volunteer for he crew .
the captain found five gunner of reputation in the port and sign them to go with he .
when the Ganymede drop she sail and slip from the harbour , a crowd of idler stand on the beach and watch she go .
<p>
they cruised to the coast of Darien look for prey , but the sea appear to be sweep clean of Spanish craft .
one morning , near the port of Cartagena , they sighted the tall red hull of a trade ship .
captain Morgan hide he man .
No soul be allow to show she .
even the steersman worked in a tiny house , while a dummy wheel swing idly on the deck .
then down on the Spanish boat they bore , and the Spanish crew be overwhelm .
here came a boat and no man working she .
It smack of witchcraft , or of one of those nameless tragedy of the sea the sailor talk about .
perhaps a plague have kill all the crew , and they could take and sell this ship .
but when they be close , three masked gun spout flame ; they fire only at one spot , and when they have done , the rudder of the Spanish ship hang in splinter and she flounder about in no control .
then captain Morgan , hanging aft , out of range of she broadside , pour shot into she hull until the flag flutter down .
It be the first prise of he plan .
<p>
A few days later he bring up with another ship and run alongside to board .
the Spanish crew be mass against the bulwark to repel the attack .
And immediately the air be fill with clay powder pot which landed in the thick group and explode .
the Spanish man run scream to the shelter of the hold to escape this flashing death .
<p>
when Henry Morgan came at last to Tortuga , four prise follow in he wake , and he have not lose a man .
It be as easy as he have known it would be .
here be four monument to he plan .
one have only to do the unexpected thing quickly .
this be the secret of successful war .
<p>
Mansveldt be in Tortuga when Henry Morgan came , and he little eyes glitter as he look at this plunder .
soon he send for this new leader .
<p>
 " you be captain Morgan who take the four prise in the harbour ? "
<p>
 " yes , sir , I be . "
<p>
 " And how do you do this thing ?
the Spanish ship be strongly armed and wary . "
<p>
 " I do it , sir , with I plan .
many nights have I considered how to do these thing .
I work with surprise , sir , when other man use only force . "
<p>
Mansveldt regard he with admiration .
<p>
 " I be fitting out an expedition to take St . Catherine isle , " he say .
 " then I be going to forme a republic of buccaneer who will fight with a patriotism .
would you like to be Vice of this expedition ?
I have some reputation for pick man . "
<p>
the name of Mansveldt be mighty on the sea , and Henry flush with pleasure .
<p>
 " I would like it , sir , " he say quickly .
<p>
the fleet sail out , and captain Morgan be Vice .
there be a fine assault ; the ship throw in they ragged horde and slaughter walk on the wall .
the island could not withstand the fierceness of the attack , and finally the fortress fell .
then the Dutch admiral draw up he government and left Henry Morgan in command while he go out to scour the world for recruit .
he and he ship be lose and never hear from again .
It be say the Spaniard strangle he in Cuba .
<p>
captain Morgan be now the paramount leader of the Spanish main .
ship fly from the way to join he fleet , to sail under he command and fight with he and share in he success .
he go up against Puerto Bello and sack the town .
the house be burned and all the helpless citizen be plunder .
when captain Morgan's ship sail off the jungle be already creep into the ruin .
<p>
for ten year he sail about the ocean , amongst the island and along the green coast of tropic America , and he be the greatest name of all who have go out for plunder .
the pirate of the world came flock to he reputation .
people cheer he in Tortuga and Goaves .
numberless man volunteer for every expedition .
now all the brotherhood wait for captain Morgan to open a keg of liquor in the street or to run wild through the town .
he never do .
coldly he walk about , clad in a purple coat and grey silk stocking and grey shoe with bow .
at he side hang a long rapier no thick than a pencil , in a scabbard of grey silk .
<p>
at first the sailor strive to establish a comradeship with he , but he prick them away with frigid insult .
the lesson of the slave live on in he .
he do not try to buy he popularity , and all the free brotherhood shower it upon he-cast they live and they fortune on the knee of he success .
<p>
1 . 3 . 2 II
ten year of fight and plunder and burning , and he be thirty .
he grey hair seem to coil more closely to he head .
Henry Morgan be successful , the most luck-follow freebooter the world have known , and the man of he profession give he that admiration he have crave .
he enemy and any man of Spain who have money be he enemy-shudder at the mention of he name .
they have place he in they fear beside drake and L'Ollonais .
<p>
he have go out with Grippo in the Ganymede , assured that when he gun roar into a Spanish hull , when he stand embattled on a Spanish deck with cry and clash of iron weapon about he , there would come that flaming happiness he heart desire .
these thing he have experienced , and there be not even content .
the nameless crave in he grow and flex it claw against he heart .
he have think the adulation of the brotherhood might salve the wind of he desire ; that when the pirate saw the result of he plan and marvel at them , he would be please and flatter .
And this thing happen .
the man fairly fawn on he , and he found that he despise them for it and considered them fool to be take with such simple thing .
<p>
Henry have grown lonely in he glory .
Old merlin have speak truth so long ago , for captain Morgan have come to he success , and he be alone in he success , with no friend anywhere .
the crave of he heart musth lie crouch within he .
all he fear and sorrow and conceit , he failure and little weakness , musth be conceal .
these , he follower , have gather to the cry of he success ; they would leave he at the first small sign of weakness .
<p>
while he be engaged in winning plunder , a little rumour have come stealthily across the isthmus , have float amongst the island and steal aboard the ship .
man catch the whisper name and listen carefully .
<p>
 " there be a woman in Panama and she be lovely as the sun .
they call she the Red saint in Panama .
all man kneel to she . "
thus say the whisper .
the voice grow and grow until man in the tavern drink to La Santa Roja .
young seaman whisper of she in the dog watch .
 " there be a woman in the cup of gold and all man fall before she as heathen kneel before the sun . "
they spoke softly of she in the street of Goaves .
No one have see she ; no one could tell the tint of she cheek or the colour of she hair .
yet , in a few year , every man in the wide , wild main have drunk to the Red saint , have dream of she ; many have pray to La Santa Roja .
she become to every man the quest of he heart , bearing the image of some fair young girl left on a European beach to be gloriously colored by the year .
And Panama be to every man the nest of he desire .
It be a curious thing .
in time , no speech amongst gather man could end without mention of La Santa Roja .
she be become a queer delirium in the mind of the rough pirate , a new virgin for they worship .
many say she be Mary come to live on earth again , and they add she name in they prayer .
<p>
now , when captain Morgan have take Puerto Bello , the governor of Panama be fill with admiration and wonder that such a ragged band of ill-order man , and without uniform , could capture such a city .
he send a messenger ask for a small sample of the weapon which have make this thing possible .
captain Morgan take the runner to a small room that have escape the general fire .
<p>
 " have you see the woman who they call the Red saint in Panama ? " he ask .
<p>
 " I have not see she , no ; but I have hear of she .
the young man put only the blessed virgin before she in they worship .
It be say that she be lovely as the sun . "
<p>
 " what be she name besides La Santa Roja ? "
<p>
 " I do not know .
I have only hear that she be lovely as the sun .
they tell in Panama that she came from Cordova and have be to Paris .
It be say she family be noble .
they tell how she ride great horse , sitting astride , in a meadow guarded with a thick hedge .
It be say that in she hand a rapier be a living thing , and that she can fence more skilfully than any man .
these thing she do in secret that no one may see the crime against she modesty . "
<p>
 " ah , well ! " say captain Morgan , " if she be beautiful enough what need have she of modesty .
this modesty be only a kind of beauty patch which be put on when there be visitor-an enthrall gesture .
I should like to see she ride .
And do you know nothing more of she ? "
<p>
 " only what they say in the tavern , sir-that she have steal worship from the blessed saint . "
<p>
captain Morgan dream long in he chair while the runner wait silently .
at last Henry shake he head , as though to disengage it of cloy thought .
he draw a pistol from he belt and give it to the messenger .
<p>
 " take this to Don Juan Perez de Guzman , and say that this be a sample of the weapon we have used in lay Puerto Bello in the dust .
but I other weapon be the strong hearts of I follower .
I will not scend he one of these , but I will bring he a great number .
And tell he to keep the pistol for a year , when I she will come to Panama to receive it from he own hands .
do you understand ? "
<p>
 " I do , sir . "
<p>
And in a few days the runner came again , bring the pistol back , and a large square emerald set in a ring .
<p>
 " I master beg that you accept this stone as a token of he regard .
he beg that you do not give she the trouble to come to Panama , for then he duty would overwhelm he admiration and force he to hang you to a tree . "
<p>
 " It be a good message , " say the captain ; " a good , brave message .
I should like to meet with Don Juan if only at sword point .
It have be long since any one defy I .
And do you learn more of La Santa Roja ? "
<p>
 " only what they tell in the street , sir .
I inquired closely for you benefit .
I be tell that in the street she wear a thick veil that none may see she face .
some think she do this so that the poor man who meet she will not kill she for love .
that be all I could learn .
have you further message , sir ? "
<p>
 " only repeat that I will go to the cup of gold within the year . "
<p>
1 . 3 . 3 III
through all he life he will have be like an iron weathervane , steadfastly pointing , always , but never long in one direction .
the Indies and the sea and pillage and glory all seem to have fail he .
he have touched all thing and watch them pale and shrivel at he touch .
And he be lonely .
he man regard he with respect and sullen awe .
they be afraid of he , and this state do not feed he vanity as once it have .
<p>
he wonder if he might not make a friend amongst he follower , but the time he have dwell alone in the castle of she have be so long that this think fill he with a curious , boyish embarrassment .
who amongst he follower might be he friend ?
he considered them , remember they sullen scowl , they gleam , avaricious eyes at the division of spoil .
he feel nothing but contempt for them .
<p>
but there be one who he have notice , a young Frenchman who be call Coeur de Gris .
captain Morgan have see he in action , leap about the deck like a supple animal while he rapier flick out in lithe tongues of silver fire .
he scorn a cutlass for the long thin blade .
<p>
And this young man answer he order with a smile at captain Morgan .
there be respect in he eyes , surely , but no fear , no jealousy , and no suspicion .
<p>
 " I wonder if this Coeur de Gris would be I friend , " muse Henry Morgan .
 " It be say that he have left a trail of break hearts from Cuba to saint kit , and somehow , for this , I fear he a little . "
<p>
captain Morgan send for the young man , and when he be come , found difficulty in speaking to he .
<p>
 " Ah-how be you , Coeur de Gris ? "
<p>
the young man be overwhelm by any show of warmth from this captain .
<p>
 " why , sir , I be very well .
have you order for I ? "
<p>
 " order ?
No ; I-I think I would like to talk with you-that be all . "
<p>
 " to talk with I , sir ?
but to talk of what ? "
<p>
 " Well be the many little love you be reputed to have ? " the captain ask in an uneasy effort at joviality .
<p>
 " repute be kind to I than nature , sir . "
<p>
Henry Morgan plunge to he purpose .
<p>
 " listen to I , Coeur de Gris !
Can you not imagine that I may need a friend ?
Can you not think of I as a lonely man ?
consider how all I follower be afraid of I .
they come for order , but never to pass a quiet time of day .
I know I make this so .
It be necessary once , for I have to build up respect before I could command obedience .
but now there be time when I should like to be telling I thought and talk of something besides war and spoil .
for ten year I have ravage the sea like a silent wolf , and I have no friend anywhere .
<p>
 " I have choose you to be I friend ; first , because I like you , and second , because you have not a thing on earth you might be thinking I want to steal .
thus you may like I without fear .
It be a strange thing how I man suspect I .
I have give a strict accounting for every voyage , yet , if I spoke to them as friend , they would beat they brain to discover I plot .
And will you be I friend , Coeur de Gris ? "
<p>
 " 'Why , certainly , I will , I captain , and have I known of such a thing in you mind , I would have be for long .
how may I serve you , sir ? "
<p>
 " oh , just by talk with I now and then , and by trustful I a little .
I have no motive save I loneliness .
but you speak and act like a gentleman , Coeur de Gris .
May I ask of you family ? or do you draw this name about you like a cape , as so many do here on the main ? "
<p>
 " It be very simple to tell you of I family .
It be say that I father be the great bra de Fer , and who he be no one ever know .
the people give I I name , remember he .
I mother be one of the free woman of Goaves .
she be sixteen when I be born .
hers be a very ancient family , but Huguenot in worship .
they holding be destroy in the murder of St . Bartholomew .
thus it came about that they be penniless when I mother be born .
And she be pick up by the watch in Paris street one day and send to Goaves with a shipload of woman vagrant .
bra de Fer found she soon afterward . "
<p>
 " but you say she be a free woman , " say Henry Morgan , scandalize at this young man apparent lack of shame .
 " surely she have give up this-this practice , now you be successful on the sea .
you be taking home enough for both of you , and more . "
<p>
 " I know I be , but she continue .
I do not mention it , for why should I interfere with what she consider a serious work .
she be proud of she position , proud that she caller be the good people in the port .
And it please she that , although she be nearly forty , she can more than compete with the young , unseasoned squab who come in every year .
why should I change the gentle course of she way , even if I could ?
No , she be a dear , lovely woman , and she have be a good mother to I .
she only fault be that she be fill with over-many little scruple .
she nag at I when I be at home , and cry so when I leave .
she be dreadfully afraid that I may find some woman who may do I harm . "
<p>
 " that be strange , be it not ? -considering she life , " say Henry Morgan .
<p>
 " why be it strange ?
musth they have a different brain in that ancient profession ?
No , sir ; I assure you that she life be immaculate-prayer thrice a day , and there be no fine house in all Goaves than hers .
why , sir , when last I go there , I take with I a scarf which fell to I lot in the division , a glorious thing of gossamer and gold .
she would not have it .
It belong about the neck of some woman who put she faith in the Romish church , she say , and it would not be decent for a good Huguenot to wear it .
ah ! she worry so about I when I be off to sea .
she be terribly afraid I may be hurt , but far more afraid of the taint of I soul .
such be all I knowledge of I family , sir . "
<p>
captain Morgan have step to a cupboard and bring out some queer little jug with wine of Peru .
there be two neck on each jug , and when the wine be pour out from one , a sweet , whistling sound came from the other .
<p>
 " I take these from a Spanish ship , " he say .
 " Will you drink with I , Coeur de Gris ? "
<p>
 " I should be very much honor , sir . "
<p>
they sit a long time sip the wine , then captain Morgan spoke dreamily .
<p>
 " I suppose , Coeur de Gris , that you will one day be strike with the Red saint , and then we shall have the bee of Panama buzz out upon we .
I have no doubt she be as jealously guarded as be Helen .
you have hear of the Red saint , have you not ? "
<p>
the young man eyes be glow with the wine .
<p>
 " hear of she ! " he say softly .
 " sir , I have dream of she and call to she in I sleep .
who have not ?
who in all this quarter of the world have not hear of she , and yet who know any single thing about she ?
It be a strange thing , the magic of this woman name .
La Santa Roja !
La Santa Roja !
It conjure up desire in the heart of every man-not active , possible desire , but the 'if I be handsome , if I be a prince kind of desire .
the young man make wild plan ; some to go disguised to Panama , other to blow it up with quantity of powder .
they day-dream of carry the Red saint off with them .
sir , I have hear a seaman all rotten with disease whisper to she in the night , 'If this thing be not on I , I would go adventure for La Santa Roja . '
<p>
 " I mother fret and fret there in Goaves , lest I go mad and run to she .
she be terrify by this strange woman .
'Go not near to she , I son , ' she say .
'This woman be wicked ; she be a devil ; besides , she be without doubt a Catholic . '
And no one have ever see she that we know of .
we do not know certainly that there exist such a woman as the Red saint in the cup of gold .
ah ! she have spread the sea with dream-with longing dream .
I have be thinking , sir , that perhaps , sometime , the cup of gold may go the way of troy town on account of she . "
<p>
Henry Morgan have fill the glasses again and again .
he be slump forward in he chair , and a little crooked smile be on he mouth .
<p>
 " yes , " he say rather thickly , " she be a danger to the peace of nation and to the peace of man mind .
the matter be wholly ridiculous , of course .
she be probably a shrewish bitch who take she bright feature from the legend .
but how might such a legend be start ?
you health , Coeur de Gris .
you will be a good friend to I and true ? "
<p>
 " I will , I captain . "
<p>
And again they sit silently , drink the rich wine .
<p>
 " but there be much suffering bound up in woman , " Henry Morgan begin , as though he have just finished speaking .
 " they seem to carry pain about with them in a leak package .
you have love often , they say , Coeur de Gris .
have you not feel the pain they carry ? "
<p>
 " No , sir , I do not think I have .
surely I have be assail by regret and little sorrow-everyone have ; but mostly I have found only pleasure amongst woman . "
<p>
 " ah , you be lucky , " the captain say .
 " you be fill with luck not to have known the pain .
I own life be poison by love .
this life I lead be forced on I by lose love . "
<p>
 " why , how be that , sir ?
surely , I have not think that you "
 " I know ; I know how I musth have change so that even you laugh a little at the think of I be in love .
I could not now command the affection of the daughter of an earl . "
<p>
 " the daughter of an earl , sir ? "
<p>
 " yes , an earl daughter .
we love too perfectly-too passionately .
once she came to I in a rose garden and lay in I arms until the dark be go .
I think to run away with she to some new , lovely country , and sink she title in the sea behind we .
perhaps even now I might be living safe in Virginia , with little joy crowd I footstool . "
<p>
 " It be a great pity , sir . "
Coeur de Gris be truly sorry for this man .
<p>
 " ah , well ; she father be informed .
on one dark night I arms be pin to I side , and she-oh , dear Elizabeth ! -was tear away from I .
they place I , still bound , in a ship , and sell I in Barbados .
Can you not see , Coeur de Gris , the bitterness that lie restlessly in I heart ?
during these year , she face have follow I in all I wandering .
somehow I feel that I might have make some later move-but she father be a powerful lord . "
<p>
 " And do you never go back for she , after you imprisonment be done ? "
<p>
Henry Morgan look down at the floor .
<p>
 " No , I friend-I never do . "
<p>
1 . 3 . 4 IV
the legend of the Red saint grow in he brain like a powerful vine , and a voice came out of the west to coax and mock , to jeer and cozen Henry Morgan .
he forget the sea and he idle ship .
the buccaneer be penniless from they long inactivity .
they lay about the deck and cursed they captain for a dream fool .
he struggle madly against the fold mesh of he dream and argue with the voice .
<p>
 " May God damn La Santa Roja for sow the world with an insanity .
she have make cut-throat bay the moon like lovesick dog .
she be making I crazy with this vain desire .
I musth do something-anything-to lay the insistent haunting of this woman I have never see .
I musth destroy the ghost .
ah , it be a foolish thing to dream of capture the cup of gold .
It would seem that I desire be death . "
<p>
And he remember the hunger which have drawn he from Cambria , for it be duplicate and strengthen now .
he thought be driving sleep away .
when drowsiness creep in on the heel of exhaustion , La Santa Roja came in , too .
<p>
 " I will take Maracaibo , " he cry in desperation .
 " I will drown this lust in a bowl of horror .
I will pillage Maracaibo , tear it to piece , and leave it bleed in the sand .
<p>
 ( there be a woman in the cup of gold , and they worship she for unnamable beauty . )
<p>
 " make the gathering at the isle de la Vaca !
call in true hearts from the corner of the sea !
we go to riches ! "
<p>
he ship fly out to the bay of Maracaibo and the town be frantic in defence .
<p>
 " run into this bottle harbour !
yes , under the gun ! "
<p>
cannon balls cry through the air and strike up cloud of dirt from the wall , but the defence hold ground .
<p>
 " It will not fall ?
then take it in assault ! "
<p>
powder pot fly over the wall , tearing and maim the defender in they burst .
<p>
 " who be these wolf ? " they cry .
 " ah , brother ! we musth fight until we die !
we musth ask no clemency , brother .
if we fall , we dear city "
ladder rose against the fort , and a wave of roaring man swarm over the wall .
<p>
 " ah , Sammarinese Lorenzo ! hide we !
bear we away !
these be no man , but devil .
hear I !
hear I !
quarter !
ah , Jesus ! where art thou now ? "
<p>
 " throw down the wall !
let no two stone stand together ! "
<p>
 ( there be a woman in the cup of gold , and she be lovely as the sun . )
<p>
 " grant no quarter !
kill the Spanish rat !
kill all of them ! "
<p>
And Maracaibo lay pleading at he foot .
door be tear from the house , and the room gut of every movable thing .
they herd the woman to a church and lock them in .
then the prisoner be bring to Henry Morgan .
<p>
 " here be an old man , sir .
we be sure he have riches , but he have hide them away and we can never find any . "
<p>
 " then put he foot in the fire ! -why , he be a brazen fool !
break he arms !
- he will not tell ?
put the whip-cord about he temple !
-Oh , kill he ! kill he and stop he scream he have no money "
 ( there be a woman in Panama )
 " have you scratch out every grain of gold ?
place the city at ransom !
we musth have riches after pain . "
<p>
A fleet of Spanish ship came sailing to the rescue .
<p>
 " A Spanish squadron coming ?
we will fight them !
No , no ; we shall run from them if we can get away .
we hull lag in the water with they weight of gold .
kill the prisoner ! "
<p>
 ( -she be lovely as the sun . )
<p>
And captain Morgan sail from break Maracaibo .
two hundred and fifty thousand piece of eight be in he ship , and roll of silken stuff and plate of silver and sack of spice .
there be golden image from the cathedral , and vestment crust with embroidery of pearl .
And the city be a fire-sweep wreck .
<p>
 " we be rich than we could have hope .
there will be joy in Tortuga when we come .
every man a hero !
we shall have a mad riot of a time . "
<p>
 ( La Santa Roja be in Panama . )
<p>
 " ah , God ! then if I musth , I musth .
but I fear I go to I death .
It be a dreadful thing to be attempt .
if this be I desire , I musth , though I die . "
he call young Coeur de Gris to he .
<p>
 " you have distinguished she in this fight , I friend . "
<p>
 " I have done what be necessary , sir . "
<p>
 " but you fight finely .
I saw you when we engaged .
now I have make you I lieutenant in the field , I second in command .
you be brave , you be sagacious , and you be I friend .
I can trust you , and who amongst I man will bear this trust if it be worth he while to fail ? "
<p>
 " It be a great honour , sir .
I will pay you , surely , with I fidelity .
I mother will be very please . "
<p>
 " yes , " say captain Morgan ; " you be a young fool , and that be a virtue in this business as long as one have a leader .
now the man be straining to get back that they may spend they money .
if it be possible they would be pushing the ship to hurry them .
what will you do with you money , Coeur de Gris ? "
<p>
 " why , I shall scend half to I mother .
the remain sum I shall divide in two .
part I shall put away , and on the other I expect to be drunk for a few days , or perhaps a week .
It be good to be drunk after fight . "
<p>
 " drunkenness have never be a pleasure to I , " the captain say .
 " It make I very sad .
but I have a new venture turning in I brain .
Coeur de Gris , what be the rich city of the western world ?
what place have be immune from the slight gesture of the brotherhood ?
where might we all make million ? "
<p>
 " but , sir , you do not think you can consider it possible to take "
 " I will take Panama-even the cup of gold . "
<p>
 " how may you do this thing ?
the city be strongly guarded with wall and troop , and the way across the isthmus be nigh impassable but for the burro trail .
how will you do this thing ? "
<p>
 " I musth take Panama .
I musth capture the cup of gold . "
the captain jaw set fiercely .
<p>
now Coeur de Gris be smile quietly .
<p>
 " why do you grin at I ? " demand captain Morgan .
 " I be thinking of a chance remarque I make a little time ago , that Panama be like to go the way of troy town . "
<p>
 " ah ! this nameless woman be in you mind .
dismiss she !
It may be there exist no such woman . "
<p>
 " but then , sir , we be rich enough of this last spoil . "
<p>
 " It would be no evil thing to grow rich .
I be tire of plunder .
I would rest securely . "
<p>
Coeur de Gris hesitate a time , while he eyes be cover with a soft veil .
<p>
 " I be thinking , sir , that when we come to Panama every man will be at he friend throat over the Red saint . "
<p>
 " oh , you may trust I to keep order amongst I man strict order-though I hang half of them to do it .
A while ago I send word to Panama that I would go there , but I do it as a joke .
And I wonder , now , whether they have be fortify she .
perhaps they , too , think it a joke .
go , now , Coeur de Gris , and speak to no man of this .
I make you I ambassador .
let the man throw they gold away .
encourage gambling-here-now-on the ship .
give them an example at the tavern-an expensive example .
then they will be drive to go out with I .
I musth have an army this time , I friend , and even then we may all die .
perhaps that be the chief joy of life-to risk it .
do I work well , Coeur de Gris , and it may be one day you will be rich than you can think . "
<p>
young Coeur de Gris stand muse by the mast .
<p>
 " we captain , we cold captain , have be bite by this great , nebulous rumour .
how strange this pattern be !
It be as though the Red saint have be steal from I arms .
I dream be violate .
I wonder , when they know , if every man will carry this feeling of a bitter loss-will hate the captain for steal he desire . "
<p>
1 . 3 . 5 V
sir Edward Morgan lead force against St . Eustatius , and , while the battle rage , a slim , brown Indian slip up and drive a long knife into he stomach .
the Lieutenant set he lip in a straight , hard line , and crumple to the ground .
<p>
 " I white breeches will be ruin , " he think .
 " why do the devil have to do it , just when we be get on so nicely .
I should have get special thanks from he majesty , and now I shall not be here to receive them .
heaven ! he chose a painful place ! "
And then the full tragedy strike he .
<p>
 " an ordinary knife , " he mutter ; " and in the stomach .
I should have prefer a sword in the hand of an equal-but a knife-in the stomach !
I musth look disreputable with all this blood and dirt on I .
And I can straighten up !
Christ ! the wretch strike a sensitive spot . "
<p>
he man sadly bore he to Port royal .
<p>
 " It be unavoidable , " he tell the governor ; " slip up on I with a knife and stab I in the stomach .
such a little devil he could reach any high , I suppose .
report the affair to the crown , will you , sir ?
And please do not mention the knife-or the stomach .
And now will you leave I with I daughter ?
I shall be dye soon . "
<p>
Elizabeth stand over he in a darken room .
<p>
 " be you hurt badly , father ? "
<p>
 " yes , quite badly .
I shall die presently . "
<p>
 " nonsense , papa ; you be only joke to excite I . "
<p>
 " Elizabeth , do it sound like nonsense-and have you ever hear I joke ?
I have several thing to speak of , and the time be very short .
what will you do ?
there be little money left .
we have be living on I salary ever since the kingbolt make he last general suggestion for a loan . "
<p>
 " but what be you talk about , papa !
you can die and leave I here alone and lose in the colony .
you can , can do it ! "
<p>
 " whether I can or not , I shall die presently .
now let we discuss this matter while we can .
perhaps you cousin who have come to such fame through robbery will care for you , Elizabeth .
I be pained at the think , but-but it be necessary to live-very necessary .
And after all , he be you cousin . "
<p>
 " I will not believe it .
I simply will not believe it .
you can die ! "
<p>
 " you musth stay with the governor until you can meet you cousin .
tell he the exact standing of the matter ; no fawn-but do not be too proud .
remember he be you own blood cousin , even though he be a robber . "
he heavy breathing fill the room .
Elizabeth have begin to cry softly , like a child who can quite tell whether or not it be hurt .
finally word be forced from sir Edward lip .
<p>
 " I have hear that you can tell a gentleman by the way he die-but I should like to groan .
Robert would have groan if he have wish .
of course , Robert be queer-but then-he be I own brother-he would have shriek if he have feel like it .
Elizabeth , will you-please-leave the room .
I be sorry but I musth groan .
never speak of it-Elizabeth-you promise-never-never to speak of it ? "
<p>
And when she came again , sir Edward Morgan be dead .
<p>
1 . 3 . 6 VI
spring have come to Cambria , well up out of the Indies and out of the hot , dry heart of Africa , and this the fifteenth spring since Henry go away .
Old Robert like to think , and then came curiously to believe , that he son send the spring to Cambria out of the tropic place .
there be a green fur climbing up the hill , and the tree be test new , fragile leave in the wind .
<p>
Old Robert face have grown more set .
around he mouth live less a smile and more a grimace , as though some ancient , anguish smile have freeze there .
ah ! the year have be lonely , barren thing , with nothing left in they arms for he .
he know the meaning , now , of Gwenliana's word-that age bring nothing with it save a cold , restless wait ; a dull expectancy of a state that might not be imagine with any assurance .
perhaps he wait for the time when Henry would come to he again .
but that could scarcely be so .
he be not at all sure that he want to see Henry any more .
It would be disturb .
when one be old , one hate disturb thing .
<p>
for a long time he have wonder , " what be Henry doing now ? what seeing now ? "
And then the boy have fade slightly , have come to be like people in old book-not quite real , yet real enough to be remember .
but Robert think often of this abstract person , he son , of who he hear waver rumour now and again .
<p>
with wake on the fine morning of the spring , Robert have say , " I will climb up to see merlin today .
strange how that old man live under the grow pressure of he year .
there musth be more than a hundred of them now .
he body be a thin wisp-nothing more than a suggestion that here be once a body .
but William say , if you can be pick think out of William speaking , that he voice be golden and strong as always , and that he still talk tremendous nonsense that would not be tolerate at London .
It be amazing how this road-mender have he whole life curl like a kitten around four days in London .
but I musth be going to merlin .
It be not likely that I shall go again . "
<p>
the steep , rocky path be a thing of torture to he ; more a cruel thing because of he memory of lithe , powerful leg , and lung as tireless as bellows .
once he have lead all comer in the mountain race , but now he climb a bit , then rest on a stone , and climb again-up and up into the cleft and over the rock shoulder .
It be noon when he came at last to Crag top .
<p>
merlin meet he at the door before he have time to knock , and merlin have no more change than the harp and spear-head hanging to he wall .
he seem to have discard time like a garment .
merlin came to Robert with no surprise .
It be as though he have known of this slow pilgrimage a thousand year before the day have happen .
<p>
 " It be very long , Robert , since you climb the path to I , and long since I go down it . "
And " down , down " sing the harp .
he spoke the language of the string , and they respond like a distant choir in high mass of the mountain .
<p>
 " but it's an old man who climb to you now , merlin .
the trail be a beast enemy to wrestle with .
you seem no old .
I wonder when you will come to die .
do not you year sometimes argue that question with you ? "
<p>
 " why , to speak truthfully , Robert , I have take it in I mind several time but always there be too many thing to think about .
I could not take the time to die .
if I do , I might not be able to think ever again .
<p>
 " for up here , Robert , that furtive hope the valley man call faith become a questionable thing .
oh , without doubt , if there be a great many about I , and they all intone endlessly the chant , 'There be a wise , kind God ; surely we shall go on living after death , ' then I might be prepare for the coming life .
but here , alone , half-way up the sky , I be afraid that death would interrupt I muse .
the mountain be a kind of poultice for a man abstract pain .
amongst them he laugh-oh , far more often than he cry . "
<p>
 " you know , " say Robert , " I mother , the old Gwenliana , make a last , curious prophecy before she die .
'This night the world end , ' she say , 'and there will be no more earth to walk upon . '
 "
 " Robert , I think she spoke truth .
I think she dye word be truth , whatever may have be she other augury .
this gnawing think come visit , sometimes , and because of it I be afraid to die-horribly afraid .
if by I living I give life to you , and fresh existence to the field and tree and all the long green world , it would be an unutterable deed to wipe them all out like a chalk drawing .
I musth not-yet awhile .
<p>
 " but enough of these foreboding thing .
there be no laughter in them .
you , Robert , have be too long in the valley of man .
you lip laugh , but there be no amusement in you heart .
I think you place you lip so , like twig over a traprock , to conceal you pain from God .
once you try to laugh with all you soul , but you do not make the satirist concession-that of buy with a little amusement at she the privilege of laugh a great deal at other . "
<p>
 " I know that I be defeat , merlin , and there seem to be no help for it .
victory , or luck , or whatever you wish to call it , appear to lie hide in a choose few as baby tooth hide under the gum .
of late year this God have a hard , calculating game with I .
there have be moment when I think he cheat . "
<p>
merlin spoke slowly : " once I play against a dear young god with goat foot , and that game be the reason for I coming here .
but then , I make the great concession and sign with sad laughter .
Robert , do I not hear a long time past that you be roving in you mind ?
surely William stopped by and tell I you have grown insane .
do you not do reprehensible thing in you rose garden ? "
<p>
Robert smile bitterly .
 " that be one of this God trick , " he say .
 " I will tell you how it be .
one day , when I be pull the dead leave from I rose , it came upon I to make a symbol .
this be no unusual thing .
how often do man stand on hill tops with they arms outstretch , how often kneel in prayer and cross she .
I pull a bloom and throw it into the air , and the petal shower down about I .
It seem that this act gather up and tell the whole storey of I life in a gesture .
then the loveliness of white petal on black earth absorbed I , and I forget I symbol .
I throw another and another , until the ground be snow with rose leave .
suddenly I look up and saw a dozen man standing about laugh at I .
they have come by from church .
'Hee ! ' they say , 'Robert have lose he mind .
Hee ! he sense be slip out of he .
ho ! he be a child again , throw rose petal . '
It seem a crazed God who could allow this thing . "
<p>
merlin be shake with a silent glee .
<p>
 " oh , Robert ! Robert ! why musth you blame the world when it protect she against you ?
I think God and the world be one to you .
if there be ten people in the valley below who like the look of rose leave on the ground , you would only be a very queer person , interesting and something of a curiosity .
they would bring stranger to you house on Sunday afternoons and exhibit you .
but , since there be none , of course you be a radical who musth be lock up or hang .
judgment of insanity be truly the hanging of a man mind if it be whisper of he that he brain wander , then nothing he can say will matter to any one ever again , except as a thing to laugh at .
<p>
 " Can you not see , Robert ?
people have so often be hurt and trap and torture by idea and contraption which they do not understand , that they have come to believe all thing passing they understanding be vicious and evil-thing to be stamp out and destroy by the first corner .
they only protect she , thus , against the ghastly hurt that can come to them from little thing grown up . "
<p>
 " I know , " say Robert ; " I know all that , and I do not cry out against it .
I great complaint be that the only possession I carry about with I be a bag of loss .
I be the owner solely of the memory of thing I used to have .
perhaps it be well-for I seem to love them more now that I have them not .
but I can understand how this fortune may be born hide in a choose few .
I own son assault and keep each one of he desire , if the wind tell truth . "
<p>
 " you have a son , Robert ; I remember now .
I think I prophesy that he would rule some world or other if he do not grow up . "
<p>
 " And so he do .
news of he come out of the south on a light , inaccurate wind .
rumour have wing like bat .
It be say that he rule a wild race of pirate ; that he have capture town and pillage city .
the English be elate , and call he a hero and a patriotic man-and so do I , sometimes .
but I fear if I be a Spaniard , he would be only a successful robber .
I have hear-though I do not believe it ; I do not want to believe it-that he have torture prisoner . "
<p>
 " So , " merlin muse , " he have come to be the great man he think he want to be .
if this be true , then he be not a man .
he be still a little boy and want the moon .
I suppose he be rather unhappy about it .
those who say child be happy , forget they childhood .
I wonder how long he can stave off manhood .
<p>
 " Robert , have you see those great black ant which be born with wing ?
they fly a day or two , then drop they wing and fall upon the ground to crawl for all they live .
<p>
I wonder when you son will drop he wing .
Is it not strange , Robert , how , amongst man , this crawl be revere-how child tear at they wing , so they may indulge in this magnificent crawl ? "
<p>
 " what make boy grow to man ? "
Robert ask .
 " what circumstance rot out they wing root ? "
<p>
 " why , a great many never have wing , and some tear them off for she ; some be sudden thing and other very tedious .
I do not know them all , but mine be ridicule-a kind of self-ridicule .
I love a small girl in the valley , and I suppose she be beautiful .
I hope I be handsome .
I make a song for she and call she the bride of Orpheus .
I rather fancied she Orpheus , then .
but she considered marriage with a deity as some manner of a crime against nature .
she lecture I .
every man , so she say , owe it to something or other-he family or he community or she , I forget just what-to make a success of she .
she be vague as to the nature of success , but she make it very plain that song be not a structure of success .
And deity she abhor , especially pagan deity .
there be a man with lands and house who be reassuringly human .
even in I old age I think spitefully that he be deplorably human .
So they be married , and ridicule gnaw off I wing .
<p>
 " I parade murder and suicide and field of glory through I mind to fight this little pain ridicule .
in I shame , I think to lock up I song from the world , so that never again might people hear them .
the world do not even know when I be go .
No little group of people came to plead with I to return-and I have promise the ridicule they would .
I bite wing drop ; I be a man and do not want the moon .
And when I try to sing again , I voice have grown husky like a drover voice , and I song be thick with forethought and plannings . "
<p>
 " I wonder how I grow , " Robert say .
 " I do not remember .
perhaps I youth go out of I stick to coin-or perhaps it live in those lands I used to dream of .
but be swim in he dream , and sometimes I be very jealous of he .
<p>
 " do you know , merlin , there be a thing which have appear strange to I .
I mother , Gwenliana , think she have the second sight , and we humour she because she take such joy of it .
And on the night that Henry go away , she cast a picture of he life .
merlin , nearly all she word have come to be the truth .
Can these thought have come on she like a series of bright painting ?
It be a strange , unlikely thing . "
<p>
 " perhaps she read he desire , Robert , and sense the strength of he desire .
I teach old Gwenliana many thing which have to do with magic ; she be very apt at reading sign-and face . "
<p>
Old Robert rose to stretch she .
 " ah , well-I musth be going now .
It take a weary time for such an aged man to be get down the path .
It will be night when I be home again .
here be William coming with he pick which be an appendage born to he .
I will be going down a bit in he company and learning the way of thing at London .
you musth love word , merlin , to be making so many of them ; and I musth love pain , to be engender it against she .
<p>
 " And , merlin , I think you be a trickster and a fraud ; every time I have go away from you it have be with the conviction that you have say mighty thing , yet , on thinking , I could never recall any of them .
I think you work a subtle conjuring with the soft voice of you , and you harp . "
<p>
And as he go down the path , the hanging harp croon after he the sorcerer farewell .

1 . 4 chapter IV
panama be a great , lovely city in 1670 when Henry Morgan determined on it destruction ; a rich , strong city , and justly call the cup of gold .
No place in all the raw New world could compare with it in beauty and in wealth .
<p>
over a century before , balboa have come to the shore of a new ocean .
he dress she in scour armour and wade into the Pacific until the gentle water washed he thigh .
then , in an oration , he firmly address the sea and claim all lands it break on for the crown of Spain .
he demand that the water be tractable and loyal , for it be to be the honor private lake of Castile and Aragon .
<p>
behind balboa , on the shore , huddle a small grass village of the Indian , and it name be Panama .
in the native tongue this signify a place of good fishing .
when the soldier of Spain put torch to the litter of hut , and in it place build a new town , they keep the old name , Panama , which be a song .
And soon the meaning justify she , for out of this little town the net of Spain be fling to the four directions .
<p>
Pedrarias carry the net to the north and enmesh the city of the ancient Mayan race .
he be enable , of he fishing , to scend strangely wrought serpent and frightful image and tiny grave insect , all of gold , to Panama .
when there be no more ornament to gather , when the temple be vacant box of stone , then Pedrarias throw the net of Spain over the people and drive them into the mine under he whips .
<p>
Pizarro sail to the southward with horse and armoured man , and the powerful Inca nation fell before he .
he kill the ruler and rip the life from the governmental structure .
then diamond , plate from the temple wall , symbol of the sun in gold , and ceremonial golden shield be ship to Panama .
And Pizarro forced the break Inca people into the mine with whips .
<p>
A hundred captain lead little band of soldier to the east and southeast where the fierce Indian of Darien live in tree and cave .
here the Spanish man found nose ring and anklet and god-stick and eagle quill fill with gold .
everything be dump into sack and carry on mule-back to Panama .
when all the grave have be rob of golden ornament , even the wild Indian dig in the earth by authority of the whips .
<p>
the ship of Spain discover little island to the westward in who shallow bayberry pearl might be found if only one dive deep enough ; and in a little time the dull folk of the island be jump into a sea where shark live .
And bags of pearl found they way to Panama .
<p>
all the long working , the craftsmanship in precious thing , came at last to Panama , where the melt pot receive them like glow gourmand and transform them to thick golden log .
the warehouse be pile high with the stick of gold , wait for the treasure fleet to sail for Spain .
at time there be bar of silver tier up in the street for lack of warehouse room , but they be safe from thievery in they weight .
<p>
meanwhile the city grow to be a glorious thing .
the wealth of enslave nation be put to building thousand of fine house with red roof and little inset patio where rare secret flower grow .
all the colored arts and comfort of old Europe fly westward to beautify the Panamanian house at the call of golden lump .
<p>
the first Spaniard to invade the country have be cruel , grasping robber ; but also they be soldier who no bloody prospect might frighten .
small band of them capture the New world with little force save spiritual courage .
but when the people of Nicaragua and Peru and Darien have become gangue of whimpering slave , when there be no danger any more , a different breed of man came to live in Panama .
these be the merchant , keenly decisive when there be a farm to be wrest by law from it owner , or when the price of food be raise for outland colonist , but fearful and cowardly when steel be rattle about on steel .
<p>
the merchant class soon dominate all the isthmus .
some of the soldier have die ; other grow restless in security and march away to new , dangerous lands , leave the battle of food-stuff and extravagance in the hands of the trader who dole out flour and wine , and gather , in return , jewel and bar of gold for they coffer .
the merchant combine so that all might charge the same high price for food , and with the profit they build they cedar house roof with rosy tile ; they dress they woman in foreign silk and be follow about in the street by band of retain slave .
<p>
A company of Genoese slave dealer came to the city and build a large warehouse for they merchandise .
in it be tier of cage where the black man sit until they be bring into the light to be feel over and bargain for .
<p>
It be a lovely city , Panama .
two thousand great cedarn house line it principal street , and farther from the center be five thousand small dwelling for clerk and messenger and pay soldier of the kingbolt .
cluster in the outskirts be innumerable thatch hut where the slave be quartered .
in the center of the town be six church , two convent , and a tall cathedral , all with full gold services and vestment heavy with jewel .
already two saint have live and die in Panama-not major saint , perhaps , but of enough importance to make they bone valuable .
<p>
one whole section of the city be crowded with the house and stable and barracks of the kingbolt .
here , one-tenth of all the produce of the land be store , wait for the next plate fleet , when it would be carry on donkey back across the isthmus to be loaded on the ship .
Panama be supporting the kingdom of Spain-pay for the kingbolt new palace and war .
because of the ready money in he treasury , the kingbolt give Panama a seat of dignity .
It bore a proud name : the Very noble and Very loyal city of Panama .
it rank be make equal with that of Cordova and Seville , for do not it official wear golden chain of office about they neck ?
And the kingbolt grant to the city a resplendent coat of arms-a shield in a field of gold on the left yoke , and on the right , two caravel and a handful of grey arrows .
above all be the north star of discovery , while the lion and castle of the twin Spanish kingdom circle around the shield .
truly Panama be one of the greatest city in the world .
<p>
the center of the cup of gold be a broad , pave plaza with a raise stand in the middle where music be play in the evening .
while it play , the people stroll about , prove they position by those to who they spoke ; the merchant aristocracy be very tender in it pride .
A man might argue over the price of flour like a Jew in the day-time , but at night , in the plaza , he bow stiffly to acquaintance not so rich as he , and imperceptibly fawn on those rich .
<p>
they have grown soft in they security .
the city be considered impregnable .
on one side the sea protect it , and there be no foreign ship on the southern ocean anyway ; to the landward side be wall and a broad morass which might be flood in time of danger , making the city a veritable island .
in addition , an attack army musth cut it way through the isthmian jungle to approach in force , musth wind through narrow pass which might easily be defend by a small body of man .
No one considered it possible that any sane leader could dream of the conquest of Panama .
And so , when Campeche and Puerto Bello and Maracaibo fell to the buccaneer , the merchant of the cup of gold shrug they shoulder and go about they usual business .
It be unfortunate , of course ; indeed it be sad that they own countryman should be so used and rob-but what could they expect ?
they city be on the wrong ocean .
Panama need never think of these disturbance except with pity .
God be good , and business-well , terrible ; no money any more , and the farmer hanging on to they goods like thieve .
<p>
Don Juan Perez de Guzman be governor of the cup of Gold-a quiet nobleman who life be devoted to be a complete gentleman and nothing else .
he drill he little army , change he uniform , and look with care to the marriage of he relative .
he have be a soldier all he life-not a good campaigner , perhaps , but an extremely gallant officer .
the communication he write to he subordinate be magnificent .
he wording of a demand for surrender by an Indian village be above reproach .
the people love they governor .
he dress so well ; he be so proud , yet condescending .
they cheer he daily as he clatter down the street with a troop of horse behind he .
if there be any apprehension of attack , surely the gallant figure of Don Juan would reassure the people .
he be the noble blood and the rich warehouse in the city .
<p>
thus they live happily in Panama , going to the green country place when the hot days be in , and return to the balls and reception of the town during the rainy season .
And this be the cup of gold when Henry Morgan determined on it destruction .
<p>
one day the news creep into Panama that the terrible Morgan be coming in conquest .
at first there be amuse unbelief , but when more messenger came in , the city rouse she to frantic activity .
the people rush to the church , confess , kiss relic , and rush home again .
hundred of priest march in procession bearing the Host through the street .
the dark brotherhood fiercely whip she and drag the heavy cross about for every one to see .
the break wall go unmended ; the rusty cannon be not replace .
Don Juan hear mass after mass , spoke to the frenzied people , and suggest a procession of all the priest in the city .
<p>
horrible storey begin to grow up-how the buccaneer be not man at all , but animal thing with heads like crocodile and lion claw .
grave man discuss such possibility in the street .
<p>
 " the blessing of the day , Don Pedro . "
<p>
 " the virgin blessing , Don Guierrmo . "
<p>
 " what be you think of these robber ? "
<p>
 " ah ! horrible , Don Guierrmo ; horrible .
they be say to be demon ! "
<p>
 " but do you think it possible , as I have hear , that Morgan she have three arms and wield a sword in each ? "
<p>
 " who can say , I friend !
the devil have even great power than these , surely .
who can tell the limit of the power of evil ?
It be sacrilegious to consider it . " .
<p>
And later : " you say you have it of Don Guierrmo ?
surely he would not tell a questionable thing-a man of he wealth . "
<p>
 " I repeat only what he say-that Morgan could fire bullet from he fingertip-that he breathed out sulphurous flame .
Don Guierrmo be certain of it . "
<p>
 " I musth tell I wife of this , Don Pedro . "
<p>
So the tales grow until the people be half mad .
storey of cruelty in other capture city be recall , and the merchant who have shrug before , turn pale on remember .
they could not believe ; and yet they musth believe , for the pirate be already on they way to Chagres , and they stated purpose be the conquest and pillage of the cup of gold .
at last , under pressure , Don Juan drag she from church long enough to scend five hundred soldier for an ambush on the road across the isthmus .
A young officer crave audience .
<p>
 " well , young man , " the governor begin , " what be you wish ? "
<p>
 " if we have bull , sir-if we have great number of wild bull , " the officer cry excitedly .
<p>
 " get them !
have the whole country scour for bull !
let the man gather a thousand of them !
but what be we going to do with them ? "
<p>
 " we should stampede them on the enemy , sir . "
<p>
 " marvellous plan !
genius of an officer !
ah , I dear friend-a thousand bull ?
A thousand ?
I jest .
have them gather ten thousand of the wild bull . "
<p>
the governor order out he soldier-two thousand of the kingbolt troop review them , and then return to kneel in the cathedral .
Don Juan be not afraid of fight , but , like a prudent general , he be strengthen stress defence .
besides , anything that cost as much as the masses he have pay for musth have some effect .
<p>
the first creep rumour grow to a monster .
quake citizen begin to bury the plate from they house .
the churchman throw chalice and candlestick into the cistern for safety , and walled up they more precious relic in passage underground .
<p>
balboa would have strengthen the wall and flood the approach .
Pizarro's army would have be half-way across the isthmus , by this time , to meet the oncoming buccaneer .
but those brave time be past .
the merchant of Panama think only of they possession , they live , and they soul-in the order name .
they never considered belting on sword or toil at the disintegrate wall .
that be for the soldier of the kingbolt , who be pay good money to protect the citizen .
the governor musth see to the defence .
<p>
Don Juan have review he troop ; that , to he mind , be all any general could do .
the uniform be proof against criticism , and he soldier would have come with credit through any parade ground in Europe .
meanwhile , another mass would not hurt matter .
<p>
1 . 4 . 1 I
while the buccaneer be throw away the saving of plunder Maracaibo , Henry Morgan plunge deeply into plan for he new conquest .
It would require more fight man than have ever before be assemble .
the messenger of captain Morgan go out to the four corner of the Spanish main .
he word found they way to Plymouth , and Nieuw Amsterdam .
even to the wooded island where man live like ape , go he invitation to the great pillage .
<p>
 " every man will be rich if we succeed " ; so run the message .
 " this will be the most powerful blow ever strike by the brotherhood .
we will carry terror to the inmost heart of Spain .
we fleet gather on the south side of Tortuga by October . "
<p>
And soon the ship and man pour to the place of rendezvous ; enormous new vessel with white sail and carve prow , ship bristle with brass cannon , old rot hulk , they bottom so foul with weed that they move through the water like log .
there came sloop and long canoe and flatboat , forced through the water with sweep .
even raft draw to the meeting place , under weave palm sail .
<p>
And the man-all the bluster brotherhood of Tortuga ; the old , expert pirate of Goaves ; Frenchman , Netherlander , English , and Portuguese-the embattled outcast of the world .
canoe loads of slave who have escape the Spaniard paddle in , drawn to this expedition by a thirst for they master blood .
the slave be Caribs and Negro and fevered whites .
little group of hunter appear on the beach of jungle island and take ship for the south side of Tortuga .
<p>
amongst the major ship be tall frigate and galleon which have be capture in old engagement .
when the time came for departure , captain Morgan have thirty-seven ship under he hand , and two thousand fight man in addition to the mariner and boy .
in the crowd of shipping lay three slim , clean sloop from New England .
they have not come to fight , but to trade-powder for plunder , whisky for gold .
powder and whiskey be the two great weapon of offence .
And besides , these Plymouth man would buy old , useless ship for the iron and cordage they contain .
<p>
captain Morgan have send hunter into the woods to shoot cattle , and ship to the mainland to steal grain .
when all return , there be food on hand for a voyage .
<p>
No one save Coeur de Gris and Henry Morgan , of all this polyglot press of man who have come at the call of conquest , know where that conquest be to be .
No one dream where they would be sailing and who fight at the journey end .
the army of brave thieve have troop to the name of Morgan , thirstily confident in he promise of unlimited plunder .
<p>
Henry Morgan have not dare to tell he destination .
potent though he name be , the buccaneer would have recoil from such an impregnable objective .
if they be give time to think of Panama , they would run home out of dread , for storey of the power and protection of the cup of gold have be tell in all they island for over half a century .
Panama be a cloud city , an eerie , half-unearthly place , and armed with lightning .
of course , there be those who believe the street pave with golden cobbles , and certain church window carve from single emerald .
these legend would draw them on , if only they have no time to think of the hazard as well .
<p>
when the ship have be careen and scrape , all the sail mend , the cannon scour and test , the hold fill with food-stuff , then Henry Morgan call a meeting of he captain for the purpose of sign solemn article and divide the fleet into command .
<p>
they gather in the oaken cabin of the Admiral-thirty captain who have bring ship to the mission .
the frigate of captain Morgan be a fine Spanish man of war .
It have be command by a duke before it fell into the pirate hands .
the cabin resemble a large drawing-room , panel in dark oak , it wall drawing slightly inward at the top .
across the ceiling be heavy beam carve with vine and delicate , slim leave .
on one wall have be the paint arms of Spain , but a dagger have scrape and scratch it nearly out of sight .
<p>
captain Morgan sit behind a broad table of which each leg be a curious carve lion , and around he , seat on stool , be the thirty leader of he fleet and army .
they wait impatiently for he communication .
<p>
there be the short , serious captain Sawkins , who eyes burned with the fervour of puritanism .
he justify he murder with scripture and offer prayer of thanks-giving from a gun carriage after a successful rape .
<p>
Black Grippo be there , an old man now , and sag ; under he unimportant infamy .
he have come , finally , to regard he God as a patient policeman who one might possibly outwit .
lately he have reasoned that he might flee he sin by a general confession and reconfirmation in he mother church , and this he intended to do when one more expedition should provide he with a golden candlestick to bear to the confess priest by way of peace offering .
<p>
Holbert and Tegna , Sullivan and Meyther , sit on stool surround captain Morgan .
in a dark corner be two who the whole brotherhood know as inseparables .
they be call simply the Burgundian and the other Burgundian .
the first be a little fat man with a face like a red bloat sun .
he be nervous and excitable .
the slight public attention throw he into a fit of embarrassment .
when he be speak to he face become redder , and he give the impression of a bug frantically look for a board under which to hide .
he companion , the other Burgundian , be he defender and guide .
the other Burgundian be tall and more powerfully make , although he left arm be go at the elbow .
these two might have be see at any time walking together , sitting together .
they seldom spoke , but always the good arm of the other Burgundian would be about the shoulder of he dumpy friend in a gesture of protection .
<p>
captain Morgan make he voice harsh and cold for he speech .
there be a deep silence while he read the article .
A man who bring a ship might draw such and such rent ; a carpenter with tool be to be pay so much ; such amount would be set aside for dependent of the slay .
then he came to the reward to the first man to sight an enemy ; the first to kill a Spaniard ; the first into the city .
the article be finished .
<p>
 " now , sign , " demand captain Morgan , and the man shuffle to the table and inscribe they name or mark .
<p>
when they be seat again , Sawkins spoke out .
<p>
 " the reward be four time as great as custom demand .
why be that ? "
Sawkins' training have make he abhor waste .
<p>
 " the man will need bravery , " Henry Morgan say calmly .
 " they will need urge-for we go to Panama . "
<p>
 " Panama ! "
It be almost a groan that answer he .
<p>
 " yes , Panama .
you have sign article-and I hang deserter .
look to the spirit of you man .
you know something of the wealth of Panama-enough to whet they tongues ; and I know the danger well enough to be sure they be surmountable . "
<p>
 " But-Panama " Sawkins begin .
<p>
 " I hang deserter , " captain Morgan say , and he left the cabin .
Coeur de Gris remain to listen .
he would report the temper of the man .
<p>
there be long silence .
every man be recall the thing he have hear about Panama .
<p>
 " It be dangerous , " say Sawkins , at last , " dangerous , but goodly rich .
And the captain swear he know the plan of the city and all the danger of the fight . "
<p>
these word bring sudden reassurance .
if captain Morgan know , then they need not fear .
Morgan be infallible .
the room fill with nervous , quick conversation .
<p>
 " money ?
they walk on it .
I have hear that the Cathedral "
 " but the jungle be impassable . "
<p>
 " they have good wine in Panama .
I taste some that came from there . "
<p>
And all at once , every man seem to think of the Red saint .
<p>
 " why , that woman be there-La Santa Roja . "
<p>
 " yes , that be right .
she be there .
who do you suppose will get she ? "
<p>
 " the captain not a man for woman at all .
I think it will be Coeur de Gris , here .
he be the most favour of we . "
<p>
 " well enough .
Coeur de Gris be fated to die on the poniard of some man jealousy .
I would not mind killing he , because if I do not , some one else would .
No , it might be I dagger . "
<p>
 " what would you do with a woman like that ?
A rope end would be the thing , I guess . "
 " well , to tell the truth , I have always found those fat doubloon the most perfect instrument of rape .
they glitter so . "
<p>
 " No , no .
but see this .
nearly all woman will repurchase they diamond with they virtue .
when you have the second , it be an easy thing to reacquire the first . "
<p>
 " what do old One-arm say about it other Burgundian ?
hey ! will you be taking the Red saint for you fat friend there ? "
<p>
the other Burgundian bow .
<p>
 " there would be no need , " he say .
 " I friend be very capable .
why , I could tell a tale " he turn to the Burgundian .
 " have I you permission , Emil ? "
<p>
the Burgundian seem trying to get through the wall , but he do manage a nod .
<p>
 " then I will tell you gentleman a storey , " the other Burgundian begin .
 " there be four friend in Burgundy ; three who squeeze a little sour milk from the dug of art , and one who have possession .
also there be a lovely girl in Burgundy ; beautiful , accomplished , a veritable Circe , most lovely in the country .
And the four friend all fell in love with this sweet exquisite .
<p>
 " each one give she the gift which be most dear to she .
the first fold he soul in a sonnet and lay it at she foot .
the second fill a viol with she name ; and I-the third , I mean-paint the rosy image of she face .
thus do we artist bid for she in all friendliness to one another .
but the last of the four be the true artist .
he be quiet ; he be subtle .
what an actor !
he win she with a superb gesture .
he open he hand-so-and there , on the cushion of he palm , lay a laugh rose pearl .
they be married .
<p>
 " now , soon after this marriage , Delphine give evidence of great virtues than any one have suspect .
not only be this paragon a perfect wife , but she be also the discreet and delightful mistress-not to one , but to all three-of the husband friend .
And Emil , the husband , do not mind .
he love he friend .
why not ?
they be he true friend , but poor .
<p>
 " ah , where be a force so blind , so idiotic , as public opinion !
this time , two death and one banishment be born of it .
this hydra of a public Opinion-consider to she what it do !
It forced Emil to challenge he three friend .
even then , all might have end with the kiss , the embrace 'my honour be whole again , dear friend'-if it have not be for Emil's deplorable habit of leave he rapier point in putrefy meat .
two of the man die , and I lose I arm .
<p>
 " now , here again come this public opinion , like a blunder , powerful ox .
have forced the duel , it forced the victor out of France .
here be Emil , beside I-lover , swordsman , artist , landowner .
the public Opinion I have stray from the tale in I hatred of this force .
what I want to tell you be that Emil ask no consideration , no quarter at all .
I know it appear that a swarm of hungry ant have be feast on he spirit ; but let great beauty be place before he , let the Red saint be mirror in those eyes , and you shall see and remember what I say .
he be quiet ; he be subtle ; he be an artist .
where other man cry 'Virility !
force !
rape ! '
-Emil carry a rose pearl in he pocket as an aphrodisiac . "
<p>
1 . 4 . 2 II
an army of flat-boat be floating on the river Chagres , each one tax to the limit of it buoyancy with the man of the free brotherhood .
Frenchman there be , wearing striped nightcap and full , loose pantaloons ; Frenchman who have sail out of St . Malo or Calais one time , and now have no fatherland to sail back to .
some of the barge be fill with cockney , dirty man for the most part , with black tooth and the look of petty thievery about them .
there be dour , silent Zeerovers from Holland , lumpishly sitting in they boat , gaze with the dull eyes of gourmand along the course of Chagres .
<p>
the heavy , square barge be pole along by Caribs and Cimarones , joyfully fierce then who love war so well that they could be persuade to bend they sleek brown shoulder to labor if the reward be blood .
one section of the parade of piracy be composed of Negro lately escape from Spanish servitude .
they wear red bandoleer , crossing like wound on they naked breast .
the leader , a huge buck with a face like a ferocious black moose , wear nothing at all save a broad yellow belt and a cavalier hat , the plume of which hang limply down and curl under he glisten black chin .
<p>
the boat , in a long line , edge up the stream .
the English shout tuneless chantey , sway they body to preserve the rhythm ; the French sing softly of the 1ittle love they might have have ; and the Cimarones and black chatter they endless monologue directed at no one in particular .
<p>
And Chagres twist on ahead in loop and tremendous horseshoe turn .
the yellow water , like a frighten , leprous woman , timidly caress the hull .
on this Chagres you might pole you boat all day , and at night make you camp not half a mile by straight line from the start place .
It be a sluggish , apathetic river of many shallow where the bright sand glitter in the sun .
Chagres be a dilettante in the eternal and understand business of river-that of get to the ocean with as little bother and effort as possible .
Chagres dream about over the country , seemingly reluctant to lose it lazy individuality in the worry sea .
<p>
after a time the boat came to a land where the thick jungle roll to the river edge and stopped in a curve crest , like a freeze green wave .
there be spotted tiger cruise along through the tree , watch the man with a sad curiosity .
now and then a great snake slip from the warm log where it have be doze in the sun , and float in the water , rear up it head to see this unheard of procession .
whole clan of excited monkey dash about amongst the vine , pretend to hate disturbance .
they howl they indignation and hurl leave and twig at the boat .
fourteen hundred outlandish being have invade sacred mother jungle ; the mangy monkey on earth have , at least , he right of protest .
<p>
the day heat have come like a breath of fever , heavy and dully bewilder .
the song from the barge thicken and die as though hot blanket have be throw over the man .
the buccaneer sit lifelessly on they bench .
but the straining Indian pole on with a steady , swing motion .
the muscle slip along they fine arms , coil and uncoil about they shoulder like restless serpent .
within they brood brain be a reverie of slaughter , a delightful blood dream .
 " on ! " say they brain .
 " on !
ugh ! the battle be two stride near .
on !
on !
ugh !
Panama ; the savanna of blood be two stride near . "
the long line of boat writhe up the river like a tremendous jointed snake .
<p>
the long ardent day fell back toward evening , and no human have be see along the river bank .
this be a serious matter , for there be no food in the barge .
there be no room for food .
every inch be need for man and weapon .
As it be , the water washed over the low deck of the artillery raft .
It be well known that many plantation border the river , whereat a hungry army might refresh she , and this knowledge have send the pirate foodless toward Panama .
all day they have watch for the plantation and have see nothing but the green tangle jungle .
<p>
in the evening , the first boat came abreast of a landing of stick .
A languid coil of smoke rose from behind a plant row of tall tree .
with loud cry of joy , the buccaneer leap from they boat and wade to the shore .
curse and despair ; the building be burned and desert .
this little smoke drift from the black heap of what have be a granary , in which no single grain remain for the man to eat .
deep tracks lead off into the wet jungle to show where the cattle have be drive away , but the tracks be two days old .
<p>
the hungry man go back to they boat .
ah , well ; they musth go hungry today .
hunger be a part of war , a matter to be expect and endure .
tomorrow , surely , they would come on house where wine be store , cold and delicious ; corral where fat cow nod stupidly , wait to be slaughter .
A buccaneer-a true buccaneer-would sell out he life for a cup of sour wine or a bit of converse with one of the brown woman of half Spain .
these be the joy of life , and a fair thing it be if the man be stab before he finished he drink or he conversation ; but hunger , tomorrow there would be food surely .
<p>
but again the sun arise , a white , fevered ulcer in the sky .
there be the river of mad turning , and along it bank desert farm , and no food at all .
news of this invasion have sweep along before them like an appalling message of pestilence .
No man or animal remain to greet the buccaneer .
<p>
on the third day they found a number of tough green cow hide , and they beat them between stone to soften them for eating .
some of the man have eat half they belt .
once a little burned maize be discover in a still burning granary , and several of the pirate die in agony from gorge on it .
<p>
the man hunted in the jungle , search through the tree for any living thing which might be eat .
even the cat and monkey seem to be league with Spain .
the jungle be silent and creatureless now .
No unit of life be left save the flying insect .
now and then a snake be catch and roast , while it captor sullenly guarded he supper .
A few mouse came into the pirate hands , but these be bolt on the spot for fear of thievery .
<p>
after four days of travel , the river grow too shallow for the boat .
the cannon be bring ashore to be drag by manpower along a narrow path .
the buccaneer straggle out in an unkempt column , while ahead of them a swarm of busy Indian , drawing energy from they sanguinary dream , hack and slash out the trail through the jungle with they heavy knife .
A few small group of flee Spaniard be see , and now and again small band of Spanish Indian flush from the thicket like covey of frighten quail , but no enemy pause long enough to give fight .
once , beside the trail , a prepare place of ambush be discover ; a wall of earth , and the ashes of many camp-fire .
It be desert .
terror have seize the soldier send to fight , and they have run away .
<p>
now the man be drag she near and near to Panama .
they enthusiasm for the conquest be go ; they cursed they leader for he failure to bring food ; they be drawn farther and farther by the sheer force of the example of captain Morgan .
<p>
from the first he have lead them , but now , at the head of the exhaust troop , Henry Morgan she be beginning to doubt whether he wish very greatly to go to Panama .
he try to remember the force which have start he on he way , the magnet of unseen beauty .
La Santa Roja have fade in he imagination as he hunger grow .
he could not clearly remember he desire .
but even though this desire should desert he utterly , he musth go on .
one failure , one moment of indecision , would scatter he success like pigeon .
<p>
Coeur de Gris be beside he as he have be from the beginning , a haggard Coeur de Gris now , who lurch a little as he walk .
captain Morgan look with pity and pride at he lieutenant .
he saw the eyes like shallow crystal , and a wild light in them as of approach madness .
captain Morgan feel less lonely with the young man by he side .
he know that Coeur de Gris be grown to be a part of he .
<p>
the sun heat be fall from the heaven like a burning rain .
It strike the ground and then slowly rose again , burden with dampness and the nauseous odour of rot leave and root .
once Coeur de Gris be drive to he knee by the heat , but immediately he rose to trudge onward .
Henry Morgan saw he stagger walk , and glance at the trail ahead with indecision .
<p>
 " perhaps we should be resting here , " he say .
 " the man be exhaust . "
<p>
 " but no .
we musth go on and go on , " Coeur de Gris reply .
 " if we stop here , the man will only be weak when we start again . "
<p>
Henry Morgan muse : " I wonder why you be so avid in I mission .
you move forward when even I begin to doubt she .
what be it that you expect to find in Panama , Coeur de Gris ? "
<p>
 " I expect to find nothing , " the young man say .
 " be you trying to traprock I into a statement of disloyalty ?
I know the prise be yours before we arrive .
I admit it , sir .
but , you see , I be like a great , round stone set in motion down a hill , so much reason have I for going to Panama .
you , sir , set I in motion . "
<p>
 " It be strange that I should so want Panama , " Henry say .
<p>
the flush face of the lieutenant turn on he in anger .
<p>
 " you do not want Panama .
It be the woman you want , not Panama . "
he voice be as bitter as he word , and now he be pressing he palm against he temple .
<p>
 " It be true , " the captain murmur .
 " It be true that I want the woman ; but that be still more strange . "
<p>
 " strange ? "
wild resentment break out in Coeur de Gris .
he shout , " strange ?
why be it strange to be lust after a woman who be known to be beautiful ?
would you call each one of these man strange , or every male thing on earth strange ?
or be you endow with a godlike lust ?
do you bear the body of a titan ?
strange !
yes , surely , I captain ; copulation and it contemplation be thing completely unique amongst man ! "
<p>
Henry Morgan be bewilder , but there be a little terror in he also .
he seem to have witness the walking of a loathsome , unbelievable ghost .
could it be that these man feel as he do ?
<p>
 " but I think there be more than lust , " he say .
 " you can understand I yearning .
It be as though I strive for some undreamed peace .
this woman be the harbour of all I quest .
I do not think of she as a female thing with arms and breast , but as a moment of peace after turmoil , a perfume after rancid filth .
yes , it be strange to I .
when I consider the year that be go away , I be bewilder at I activity .
I go to mighty trouble for silly , golden thing .
I do not know the secret which make the earth a huge chameleon .
I little war seem the scramble of a person strange to I , a person who do not know the way of making the world change colour .
I mourn , in the old time , when each satisfaction die in I arms .
Is it any wonder they all die ?
I do not know the secret .
No , you can understand I yearning . "
<p>
Coeur de Gris be grasping he ache temple between he hands .
 " I do not understand ! " he cry scornfully .
 " do you think I do not understand ?
I know ; to you mind you feeling be new thing , discovery of fresh importance .
you failure be unprecedented .
this gigantic conceit will not allow you to believe that this cockney behind you-yes , he who sometimes roll on the ground in fit-might have the same hope and despair as she .
you can believe that these man feel as deeply as you do .
I suppose it would surpass you wild think if I should say I want the woman as much as you do , or that I could be telling sweet sentence to La Santa Roja , perhaps , good than you could . "
<p>
captain Morgan have flush under the lash of word .
he do not believe it .
It be monstrous to think that these man could feel as he do .
such a comparison make he , somehow , unworthy .
<p>
 " you wonder why I say these thing ? "
Coeur de Gris continue .
 " I will tell you .
the pain have make I mad , and I be going to die . "
he walk on silently for a little distance , then suddenly he scream and fell heavily to the ground .
<p>
for a full minute captain Morgan look at he .
then a great , harsh wave seem to break forth in he chest .
he know that minute how much he have come to love the young lieutenant , know that he could not bear to lose young Coeur de Gris .
now he have drop to he knee beside the silent figure .
<p>
 " water ! " he cry to the near buccaneer , and when the fellow only stare at he : " water ! bring water-water ! "
he hand be hysterically jerk at a pistol in he belt .
they bring he water in a hat .
all the pirate saw they cold captain kneel on the ground , stroke the damp , shine hair of Coeur de Gris .
<p>
the young man eyes open slowly and he try to rise .
<p>
 " I be sorry , sir .
the pain in I head , you know sun suck out I wits .
but you musth get up , sir !
the man will lose respect for you if they see you kneel here . "
<p>
 " lie still , boy !
lie quietly !
you musth not move yet .
I be afraid .
in a moment I think you be dead , and all the world shrivel .
lie quietly !
now I be glad .
you musth not move .
now we will take the cup of cold together , and it shall be a chalice of two handle . "
he lift Coeur de Gris and carry he to the shade of a huge tree .
the buccaneer rest on the ground while they lieutenant regain he strength .
<p>
Coeur de Gris be leaning back against the tree .
he be smile at the captain with a queer womanish affection .
<p>
 " Am I like the cockney ? "
Henry Morgan ask a little wistfully ; " like the cockney with fit ? "
<p>
Coeur de Gris laugh .
<p>
 " you know nothing at all about the man .
you might be proud to resemble he .
I will tell you , for I know that to you he be only a figure of wood to take order .
the man name be Jones .
all he life he have want to be a preacher of the gospel .
he think he fit be visitation of the holy ghost , test he for some divine mission .
once he stand on a corner and spoke to the people of London , and the watch came upon he as he talk .
the law take he as a vagrant and ship he to the island .
<p>
 " this Jones , after he term be done , become a pirate to keep from starve .
there be a division of spoil from a raid , and to he share fell a woman slave , a Spaniard with Negro blood .
he married she to save she reputation .
he do not know how little be left to save .
you see , sir , he wife be a Catholic .
she will not let he read the Bible when he be at home .
And do you know , sir , he truly believe that thievish circumstance have rob he of success ; not success as you and I know it , but the success that come of God especial favour .
he imago he might have be a Protestant Savonarola . "
<p>
 " but he fit " say Henry Morgan .
 " he horrible fit I have see them . "
<p>
again the young man laugh .
<p>
 " the fit ?
ah , the fit be a gift-an heirloom . "
<p>
 " And you think he feel ? "
<p>
 " yes , perhaps he do .
remember , he married she to save she name , and keep she with he when he found what that name be .
And you will see he bashfully claim a crucifix at the division of spoil .
he will take she a crucifix from Panama .
think , man !
he be a separatist from the church .
he abhor crucifix ! "
<p>
1 . 4 . 3 III
onward the buccaneer drive she toward Panama .
they have eat leather and bitter jungle root , rodent and snake and monkey .
they cheek be shallow cup under they cheek bone ; they eyes glitter with fever .
now that they enthusiasm be go , they be drag onward by the knowledge of they captain infallibility .
Morgan could not fail because he never have fail .
surely he have a plan which would put the gold of the New world in they pocket .
And the word gold , though it have lose it meaning of reality , be more important than the word hunger .
<p>
on the eighth morning a scout came to captain Morgan .
<p>
 " the way be blocked , sir .
they have throw up a little earthwork in front of we and mounted cannon . "
<p>
at a command , the head of the wriggle column swing to the left and begin to gnaw it way through thick underbrush .
in the evening they came to the top of a small , round hill , and there below them be Panama lave in the golden light of the western sun .
each man search he neighbour face to be assured that this be not he own personal hallucination .
<p>
one pirate move to the hill edge .
he stopped still and shout crazily , and then he companion saw he running down the hill , drag at he sword as he run .
A herd of cattle be feed in the hollow below them , left there by some blunder Spaniard .
in a moment the whole fourteen hundred man be stampede down the hill .
they kill the cow with they sword ; they lunge and slash at the frighten animal .
soon , very soon , the blood be dripping down the beard of the famish man , the red drops fall on they shirt .
during that night they gorge she into unconsciousness .
<p>
while the dark be down , the pirate scout be ranging over the plain like werewolf ; they slip to the wall and count the soldier before the town .
<p>
And early in the morning , captain Morgan arouse he man and call them together to give them the order for the day fight .
Henry Morgan have come to know the buccaneering soul .
he lift out the brain of he man and mould them for battle .
he spoke to they fear .
<p>
 " It be nine day journey back to the river mouth where the ship lie-nine days , and no food at all .
you could not get to the ship even if you want to run away .
And here be Panama .
while you be sleep like hog , the scout be busy .
before this city , four thousand soldier be drawn up , with wing of cavalry .
these be not countryman with gun and knife , but drill soldier in red coat .
this be not all .
there be bull to be loose against you-against you cattle hunter . "
A laugh follow he last word .
many of these man have live in the jungle and have make they livelihood with hunting wild cattle .
<p>
the captain rub they avarice : " gold and jewel past hope of count be in the city .
every man of you will be rich if we succeed . "
<p>
they hunger : " think of the roast meat , the barrel of wine in the cellar , the spice pudding .
imagine them ! "
<p>
they lust : " woman slave there be in the city , and thousand of other woman , God know !
you difficulty will be only in judge which to choose from the multitude that will fall to we .
these be not grubby field woman , but great ladies who lie in silken bed .
how will you skin feel in bed like those , do you suppose ? "
<p>
And last , because he know them very well , he raise the standard of they vanity .
<p>
 " the name of those who take part in this fight will climb the stairs of history .
this be no pillage , but glorious war .
imagine to she the people of Tortuga pointing to you and saying , 'That man be in the fight at Panama .
that man be a hero , and rich . '
think how the woman of Goaves will run after you when you go home again .
there be the cup of gold before you .
Will you run away ?
many will die in the field today , but those who remain will carry golden Panama home in they pocket . "
<p>
A hoarse cheer arise .
the French kiss they hands to Henry Morgan ; the Caribs chatter and roll they eyes .
the gourmand Zeerovers look dully at the white city .
<p>
 " one thing more , " say the captain .
 " the troop will be drawn up in a line , if I know these Spanish captain .
they like to make as great a show as possible .
you order be to fire at they center , all of you ; and when that center be weaken , then charge and split them . "
<p>
they move out on the plain , a dense cloud of man .
two hundred marksman walk in advance , while the rest be group behind .
<p>
now Don Juan , the governor of Panama , stand with he neat army , a long line of foot soldier in company of two file .
he look at the rough formation of the enemy with contempt .
almost gaily he signal for the first advance .
<p>
the Spanish cavalry swing out , wheel and whirl across the plain .
now they form a V , and now a hollow square .
moving at a fast trot , they go through all the intricate evolution of a revue ; they make triangle , T .
in one moment every sword glance in the sunlight , then be make to disappear by twist wrist , and then to flash again .
Don Juan groan with admiration .
<p>
 " look at them , I friend ; look at Rodriguez , I beloved captain .
ah , Rodriguez ! be it really I who have teach you these thing ?
Can it be that this be the Rodriguez I hold in I arms a little time ago ?
he be a baby then , but now he be a man and a hero .
see the line , the sureness , the precision .
see Rodriguez with he troop , I friend .
how may these beast of buccaneer overcome horseman like mine ? "
<p>
Rodriguez , at the head of he troop , seem to hear the governor praise .
he shoulder stiffen .
he rose in he stirrup and give the signal for the charge .
the bugle sing excitedly .
the hoof roar with a hollow rolling sound over the turf .
they coming be like a red wave with a silver crest .
Rodriguez turn in he saddle and look proudly at the hurtle troop behind he , following he order as though they be the multimembers of one great body govern by he brain .
every sabre be line along a horse neck .
Rodriguez turn again to look once more at he lovely Panama before the shock .
And then the whole troop ride headlong into a marsh .
they know it be there , but in the enthusiasm of the moment , in the excitement of they figure , they have forget about it .
in a second the horse of Panama be a break jumble of man and fall beast .
they be fly catch in a green fly-paper .
<p>
Don Juan look dazedly at the pile of writhe , mangle body out on the plain , and then he burst into sob like a child who have see he bright toy break in the road .
the governor do not know what to do .
he brain be heavy with a red sorrow .
he turn about and start plod homeward .
he would go and hear a mass in the cathedral , he think .
<p>
the Spanish staff have grown frantic .
Red and gold uniform be rush about in every direction .
every officer shout command at the top of he voice .
the young lieutenant who have bring up the cattle finally make she hear .
<p>
 " turn loose the bull-the bull , " he cry , over and over , until the other be shout it also .
the Indian who hold the bull tear out the nose ring and begin prod the great beast forward with they goad .
slowly the herd move out across the plain .
then a red monster break into a slow run , and immediately the whole band be running .
<p>
 " they will trample these robber into the grass , " say a Spanish officer wisely .
 " where they pass , we shall find buttons , piece of weapon-nothing more-on the bloody ground . "
<p>
the bull gallop slowly toward the rough line of the buccaneer .
suddenly the two hundred marksman kneel arid fire-fire quickly , like man hunting game .
A kick , bellow wall seem to rise up in the path of the running animal .
those of the herd that be not cripple halt in they tracks , sniff the blood , milled , and then stampede in terror back on the Spanish rank .
the officer be right .
where they pass , nothing remain except buttons and break weapon and bloody turf .
<p>
in the horror of the stampede the buccaneer have charge .
now they dash into the hole the bull have make , and drive the split defender left and right .
there be a few war cry , but these be continental soldier .
they could not understand this kind of fight .
these terrible vagrant laugh and kill man with both of they hands .
the man of Spain hold ground for a little while , but then they hearts break under they fine red coat , and they run away to hide in the jungle .
little knot of buccaneer pursue them , spit those who fell exhaust .
soon the defend troop be scatter .
some of them climb into the tree and hide she amongst the leave ; some lose she in the mountain and be never found .
the cup of gold lay helpless before Henry Morgan .
<p>
A crowd of shout man pour through the undefended gate and up the broad street .
at crossing alley , part of the line change it course , like a river flow backward into it tributary .
now and then a party would detach she from the main body and move on one of the imposing house .
there would be kick on the door , a rush , and the door would fold inward like the cover of an enormous book .
the man would crowd through the entrance-cry and a scream or two .
an old woman lean from a window and look with curiosity at the invader .
then disappointment show in she face .
<p>
 " hi ! " she scream to a window across the way .
 " look at this , will you !
these thieve look very much like we own Spaniard .
they be not devil at all , but only man . "
she seem to resent they humanity .
she withdraw she head as though she renounce them for be only man .
<p>
in the afternoon a fire break out .
tall flame lance into the sky .
A section catch , a street ; half the city be burning .
<p>
Henry Morgan go to the palace of the governor to establish he quarters , and there , in the doorway , stand Don Juan Perez de Guzman , with a naked rapier in he hand .
<p>
 " I be the governor , " he say brokenly .
 " I people look to I to defend them against this scourge .
I have fail-but perhaps I can manage to kill you . "
<p>
Henry Morgan look at the ground .
something about this hysterical man unnerve he .
 " I do not set the fire , " he say .
 " some of you own slave do that out of revenge , I think . "
<p>
Don Juan move forward with he drawn rapier .
 " defend she ! " he cry .
<p>
captain Morgan do not change he position .
<p>
the sword drop from the governor hand .
 " I be a coward-a coward , " he cry .
 " why do I not strike without speaking ?
why do you not oppose I ?
ah , I be a coward !
I wait too long .
I should never have speak at all , but drive I point into you throat .
I want to die a moment ago-to die as a kind of atonement for I failure-and to take you with I as a peace offering to I conscience .
Panama be go-and I should be go , too .
It be as though a finger continue to live after the body have die .
but I can die now .
I have the courage .
And I can kill you .
I realize how I pretend .
ah ! if I have only act quickly !
if I have not speak " he walk away toward the gate and the open country .
Henry Morgan watch he drunkenly lurch out of the city .
<p>
the black night came .
nearly all of the city be in flame , a garden of red fire .
the tower of the cathedral crash down and throw a heaven of sparks into the air .
Panama be dye in a bed of flame , and the buccaneer be murder the people in the street .
<p>
all night the captain sit in the audience chamber while he man bring in the gather plunder .
they pile golden bar on the floor like cordwood , bar so heavy that two man carry each of them with difficulty .
there be little stack of jewel like glitter haycock , and in a corner the precious vestment of the church be heap , the stock of a heavenly old clothes market .
<p>
Henry Morgan sit in a tall chair carve in the likeness of many serpent .
<p>
 " have you found La Santa Roja ? "
<p>
 " No , sir .
the woman of the town be more like devil . "
<p>
prisoner be bring in to be put to the torture with a thumbscrew take from the Spanish prison .
<p>
 " kneel !
you wealth ?
[Silence] turn , Joe ! "
<p>
 " mercy !
mercy !
I will lead you ; I swear it .
A cistern near I house . "
<p>
Another " kneel !
you wealth ?
turn , Joe ! "
<p>
 " I will lead you . "
<p>
As regular , ruthless , and unfeeling they be as master slaughterer in a cow pen .
<p>
 " have you found La Santa Roja ?
I will hang all of you if she be harm . "
<p>
 " No one have see she , sir .
the man , except a few , be drunk . "
<p>
all through the night each confession of wealth conceal , the victim be lead out by a party of searcher , and soon they would return , bearing cup and silver plate , jewel , and clothing of colored silk .
the glow treasure in the hall of audience be becoming one enormous heap .
<p>
And captain Morgan , wearily : " have you found the Red saint ? "
<p>
 " we have not found she , sir , but we be seek and inquiring over the whole city .
perhaps in the daylight , sir "
 " where be Coeur de Gris ? "
<p>
 " I think he be drunk , sir , but " he look away from Henry Morgan .
<p>
 " but what ?
what do you mean ? " the captain cry .
<p>
 " nothing ; I mean nothing at all , sir .
It be almost certain that he be drunk .
only it take such gallon of wine to make he drunk , and perhaps he have found a friend in the meantime . "
<p>
 " do you see he with any one ? "
<p>
 " yes , sir , I saw he with a woman , and she be drunk .
I could swear that Coeur de Gris be drunk , too . "
<p>
 " do you think the woman might have be La Santa Roja ? "
<p>
 " oh , no , sir ; I be sure it be not she .
only one of the woman of the town , sir . "
<p>
there be a clash of golden service throw on the pile .
<p>
1 . 4 . 4 IV
A yellow dawn creep out of the little paint hill of Panama and grow bold as it edge across the plain .
the sun flash up from behind a peak , and it golden ray seek for they city .
but Panama have die , have feel the quick decay of fire in one red night .
but then , as the sun be a fickle sphere , the seek beam found joy in the new thing .
they light on the poor ruin , peer into upturn dead face , race along the clutter street , fell headlong into break patio .
they came to the white palace of the governor , leap through the window of the audience chamber , and fingered the golden heap on the floor .
<p>
Henry Morgan be asleep in the serpent chair .
he purple coat be draggle with the mud of the plain .
the grey-clad rapier lay on the floor beside he .
he be alone in this room , for all the man who have help to pick the city bone during the night have go away to drink and to sleep .
<p>
It be a high , long room , walled with panel of polished cedar .
the beam of the ceiling be as black and heavy as old iron .
It have be a court of justice , a place of wedding feast , the hall where ambassador be toast or murder .
one door open on the street ; the other , a broad , arched opening , let into a lovely garden about which the palace lay curl .
in the middle of the garden a little marble whale spout it steady stream into a pool .
there be giant plant in red glaze pot , plant with purple leave and flower who petal bore arrow heads or hearts or square in cardinal .
there be shrub , line with harsh tracery in the mad colour of the jungle .
A monkey no large than a rabbit pick over the gravel of the path , look for seed .
<p>
on one of the stone seat of the garden a woman be sitting .
she pull a yellow flower to bit while she sing fragment of a tender , silly song " I would pluck the flower of the day for you , I love , where it grow in the dawn . "
she eyes be black , but opaque .
they be the rich , sheen , shallow black of a dead fly wing , and under the lid there be sharp little lines .
she could draw up the under lid of she eyes so that they shine with laughter , though she mouth remain harsh and placid .
she skin be very pale , she hair straight and black as obsidian .
<p>
now she look at the sun inquisitive light , and now at the arched doorway of the hall of audience .
she sing stopped .
she listen intently a moment , then start the gentle song again .
there be no other sound save the distant crackling of the fire which still burned amongst the palm slave hut on the outskirts of the city .
the little monkey came at a funny , crooked gallop along the path .
he stopped in front of the woman and raise he black paw above he head as though in prayer .
<p>
the woman spoke softly to he .
 " you have learned you lesson well , chico .
you teacher be a Castilian with a fearful moustache .
I be well acquainted with he .
do you know , chico , he want what he consider I honour .
he will not be satisfy until he have add I honour to he own , and then he will be almost boastful .
you have no idea of the size and weight of he honour even as it be .
but you would be satisfy with a nut , would you , chico ? "
she drop a piece of she flower to the tiny beast , whereupon he seize it , put it in he mouth , and spit in disgust .
<p>
 " chico !
chico ! you forget you teacher !
that be all wrong .
you will get no woman honour by it .
place the flower over you heart , kiss I hand with a loud snap sound , and then stride off like a fierce sheep out searching for wolf . "
she laugh and glance again toward the doorway .
although there be no sound , she rose and walk quickly toward the hall of audience .
<p>
Henry Morgan have turn slightly in he chair , and he turning allow the sunlight to beat upon he eyelid .
suddenly he sit up and stare about he .
he look with satisfaction at the heap of treasure on the floor , then gaze full in the eyes of the woman standing under the broad arch .
<p>
 " And have you ruin we poor city enough for you satisfaction ? " she ask .
<p>
 " I do not burn the city , " Henry say quickly .
 " some of you Spanish slave set the torch . "
the word have be forced from he .
he remember that he be surprise .
 " who be you ? " he demand .
<p>
she move a step into the hail .
 " I name be Ysobel .
It be say that you seek I . "
<p>
 " seek you ? "
<p>
 " yes .
I have be call La Santa Roja by certain young idiot , " she say .
<p>
 " You-the Red saint ? "
<p>
he have prepare a picture in he mind , a picture of a young girl with blue , seraphic eyes that would fall before the steady stare of a mouse .
these eyes do not fall .
under they soft black surface they seem to be laugh at he , making light of he .
this woman face be sharp , almost hawk-like .
she be beautiful , truly , but hers be the harsh , dangerous beauty of lightning .
And she skin be white-not pink at all .
<p>
 " you be the Red saint ? "
<p>
he be not prepare for this change of idea .
he be stagger at such a revolt against he preconception .
but , say he mind , twelve hundred man and more have break they way through the jungle , have dash on the city like a brutal wave .
hundred of humans have die in the agony of wound , hundred be cripple , the cup of gold be a ruin ; and all these thing have be done that Henry Morgan might take La Santa Roja .
with all this preparation , it musth be certain that he love she .
he would not have come if he have not love she .
whatever the shock of she appearance , he could not circumvent the logic that he love she .
It musth be so .
always he have think of the " saint " in she name ; and now he perceive the reason for the adjective .
but a queer feeling be seep in on he-no logical feeling at all .
he remember such sensation from a time long go ; he be drawn , yet repel by this woman , and he feel she power to embarrass he .
Morgan closed he eyes , and the figure of a slender little girl with golden hair stand in the darkness of he brain .
<p>
 " you be like Elizabeth , " he say , in the dull monotone of one dream .
 " you be like , and yet there be no likeness .
perhaps you master the power she be just learning to handle .
I think I love you , but I do not know .
I be not sure . "
<p>
he eyes have be half closed , and when he open them there be a real woman before he , not the wraith-like Elizabeth .
And she be gaze at he with curiosity , and perhaps , he think , with some affection .
It be queer that she have come to he when no one have forced she to come .
she musth be fascinate .
he reach into he memory for the speech he have build on he way across the isthmus .
<p>
 " you musth marry I , Elizabeth .
I think I love you , Ysobel .
you musth come away with I and live with I and be I wife , under the protection of I name and of I hand . "
<p>
 " but I be already married , " she interpose ; " quite satisfactorily married . "
<p>
he have even foresee this .
during the nights of the march he have plan this campaign as carefully as he might have plan a battle .
<p>
 " but be it right that two , meeting and flaming white fire , should go apart for stark eternity , should trudge off into bleak infinity ; that each of these two should bear black ember of a flame that have not burned she to death ?
Is there anything under heaven to forbid we this burning ?
heaven have give the deathless oil ; each of we carry a little torch for the other .
ah , Ysobel-deny it , or shrink from the intrude knowledge if you will .
you would vibrate to I touch like the fine body of an old violin .
<p>
 " you be afraid , I think .
there be in you mind a burrow apprehension of the world ; the pry world , the spiteful world .
but do you not be fearsome , for I say to you that this world be a blind , doddering worm , knowing three passion only-jealousy , curiosity , and hate .
It be easy to defeat the worm , so only you make the heart a universe to she .
the worm , have no heart , can conceive the working of a heart .
he lie confounded by the star of this new system .
<p>
 " why do I tell you these thing , Ysobel-knowing you will understand them ?
you musth understand them .
perhaps I know by the dark , sweet music of you eyes .
perhaps I can read the throb heart-beat on you lip .
you beating heart be a little drum urge I to battle with you fear .
you lip be like twin petal of a red hibiscus .
<p>
 " And if I find you lovely , be I to be put in fear by a dull circumstance ?
May I not speak I think to you who it most concern next to she ?
do not let we go apart bearing black ember of a flame that have not burned she to death . "
<p>
when he have start to speak she listen carefully to he word , and then a little pain have flit across she face ; but when he have done there be only amusement in she eyes-that and the lurk ridicule under they surface .
Ysobel laugh softly .
<p>
 " you forget only one thing , sir , " she say .
 " I do not burn .
I wonder if I shall ever burn again .
you do not carry a torch for I-and I hope you do .
I came this morning to see if you do .
And I have hear you word so often and so often in Paris and Cordova .
I be tire of these word that never change .
Is there some book with which aspiring lover instruct she ?
the Spanish man say the same thing , but they gesture be more practice , and so a little more convincing .
you have much to learn . "
<p>
she be silent .
Henry look at the floor .
he amazement have raise a fog of dullness in he brain .
<p>
 " I take Panama for you , " he say plaintively .
<p>
 " Ah-yesterday I hope you do .
yesterday I dream you have , but today I be sorry . "
she spoke softly and very sadly .
<p>
 " when I hear of you and you bluster up and down the ocean , I think of you , somehow , as the one realist on an earth of vacillation .
I dream that you would come to I one day , armed with a transcendent , silent lust , and force I body with brutality .
I crave a wordless , reasonless brutality .
the long think of it bore I up when I be parade by I husband .
he do not love I .
he be flatter with the think that I love he .
It give he importance and charm in he own eyes , neither of which be he .
he would take I through the street and he eyes would say , 'See what I have married !
No ordinary man could marry such a woman ; but then , I be not an ordinary man . '
he be afraid of I-a little man , and afraid of I .
he would say , 'With you permission , I dear , I shall exercise the prerogative of a husband . '
ah , the contempt I have for he !
<p>
 " I want force-blind , unreasoning force-and love not for I soul or for some imagine beauty of I mind , but for the white fetish of I body .
I do not want softness .
I be soft .
I husband use scent lotion on he hands before he touch I , and he finger be like thick , damp snail .
I want the crush of hard muscle , the delicious pain of little hurt . "
<p>
she search he face closely , as though look once more for a quality which have be lose .
<p>
 " I think richly of you once , you grow to be a brazen figure of the night .
And now-I find you a babbler , a speaker of sweet , considered word , and rather clumsy about it .
I find you be no realist at all , but only a bungling romancer .
you want to marry I-to protect I .
all man , save one , have want to protect I .
in every way I be more able to protect she than you be .
from the morning of I first memory I have be make sick with phrase .
I have be dress in epithet and feed endearment .
these other man , like you , would not say what they want .
they , like you , feel it necessary to justify they passion in they own eyes .
they , like you , musth convince she , as well as I , that they love I . "
<p>
Henry Morgan have sunk he head , seemingly in shame .
now he start toward she .
<p>
 " but I will force you then , " he cry .
<p>
 " It be too late-I would perforce think of you standing there , declaim you considered word .
while you wrench at I clothing , I would picture you fawn before I , blurt out you word .
And I should laugh , I'm afraid .
I might even protect she-and you , who should be somewhat an authority on rape , musth know the consequence of that .
No , you have fail and I be sorry of you failure . "
<p>
 " I love you , " he say miserably .
<p>
 " you speak as though it be some new , tremendous thing .
many man have love I ; hundred have say they do .
but what be you going to do with I , captain Morgan ?
I husband be in Peru , and I inheritance be there also . "
<p>
 " I-I do not know . "
<p>
 " but be I to be a slave-a prisoner ? "
<p>
 " yes ; I musth take you away with I .
the man would laugh at I , else .
It would ruin discipline . "
<p>
 " if I musth be a slave , " she say , " if I musth go away from I own country , I hope I shall be you slave-yours or the property of a charming young buccaneer I meet last night .
but I do not think you will take I , captain Morgan .
No ; I do not think you will force I to go , for I will , perhaps , twist the knife I have already in you breast . "
<p>
Henry Morgan be arouse .
<p>
 " who be this young buccaneer ? " he ask crossly .
<p>
 " ah , you perceive the knife , " say Ysobel .
 " And how do I know the fellow ?
but he be charming , and I should like to see he again . "
<p>
the captain eyes be flaming with rage .
<p>
 " you will be lock up , " he say harshly .
 " you will remain in a cell until the time when we go again to Chagres .
And we shall see whether this knife you speak of be sharp enough to keep you here in Panama . "
<p>
As she follow he across the garden to she jail , she clear laughter ring out .
 " captain Morgan , it have just occur to I-I have begin to see that a great many different kind of man make the same kind of husband . "
<p>
 " get to you cell , " he order she .
<p>
 " Oh-and captain Morgan , you will find an old woman on the step of the palace .
I duenna , she be .
scend she to I , please .
And now , good-by for the time , sir ; I musth get to I devotion .
the sin to be dissolve , captain Morgan , be truthfulness .
It be a bad thing for the soul , truthfulness . "
<p>
he go slowly back to he chair in the hall of audience .
he be fill with a kind of shame for he manhood .
It be as though she have pluck he rapier from it scabbard and scratch he face with it while he stand helpless before she .
she have beat he without apparent effort .
now he quail before the knowledge of he man laughter when they discover he embarrassment .
there would be snicker when he back be turn .
group of pirate would be silent as he pass , and when he have go they would break into sharp laughter .
this hide ridicule be terrify to Henry Morgan .
he hate begin to raise they heads ; hatred not for Ysobel , but for he town man who would laugh at he ; for the people of Tortuga who would tell the storey in the tavern ; for the whole Indian coast .
<p>
now from the little prison across the garden came a shrill voice pray to the virgin .
the penetrating sound charge the whole palace with a fervent cacophony .
Henry Morgan listen with shame-sharpen ear for mockery in the word or in the tone , but there be no mockery .
over and over , a shrill Ave Maria ; the tone of a fearful , pleading sinner pro nobis .
A shatter world , and the black skeleton of a golden city pro nobis .
No mockery at all , but broken-hearted repentance reading it poor testimony on the drop bead .
A shrill woman voice , piercing , insistent-it seem to be dig at a tremendous , hopeless sin .
she have say it be the sin of truthfulness .
 " I have be honest in I be , and that be a black lie on the soul .
forgive I body it humanity .
forgive I mind which know it limitation .
pardon I soul for be anchor this little time to both .
Ora pro nobis . "
<p>
the mad , endless rosary canker in Henry brain .
at last he seize he rapier and he hat and run from the hail into the street .
behind he the treasure lay smile under the slanting sun .
<p>
the street about the governor palace have not be touched by the fire .
captain Morgan walk along the pave way until he came to the way of ruin .
here blacken wall have spill they stone into the road .
those house which have be make of cedar be vanish into the frame of smoke ashes which marked they place .
here and there lay murder citizen grin they last agony into the sky .
<p>
 " they face will be black before the night , " Henry think .
 " I musth have them removed or the sickness will come . "
<p>
dally cloud of smoke still arise from the city , filling the air with the sickly odour of damp thing burning .
the green hill beyond the plain seem incredible to Henry Morgan .
he regard them closely and then look back at the city .
this destruction which have seem so complete , so awful , during the night , be , after all , a pitifully small and circumscribe destruction .
Henry have not think of the hill remain green and standing .
this conquest , then , be more or less unimportant .
yes , the city be in ruin .
he have destroy the city , but the woman who have drawn he to the cup of gold elude he .
she escape while she still lay in he power .
Henry wince at he impotence , and shudder that other people should know it .
<p>
A few buccaneer be poke about in the ashes , look for melt plate which might have escape the search of the night before .
turning a corner , Henry came upon the little cockney Jones , and saw he quickly thrust something into he pocket .
A flame of rage arise in captain Morgan .
Coeur de Gris have say that there be no difference between this epileptic dwarf and Henry Morgan .
No difference , indeed !
this man be a thief .
the rage change to a fearful lust to hurt the little man , to outrage he , to hold he up to scorn as Henry Morgan have be scorn .
the cruel desire make the captain lip grow thin and white .
<p>
 " what have you in you pocket ? "
<p>
 " Nothing-nothing , sir . "
<p>
 " let I see what you have in you pocket . "
the captain be pointing a heavy pistol .
<p>
 " It's nothing , sir-only a little crucifix !
I found it . "
he draw out a golden cross stud with diamond , and on it a Christ of ivory .
 " you see , it's for I wife , " the cockney explain .
<p>
 " ah ! for you Spanish wife ! "
<p>
 " She's half Negro , sir . "
<p>
 " you know the penalty for conceal spoil ? "
<p>
Jones look at the pistol and he face grey .
 " you would not , sir , you would not " he begin chokingly .
then he seem to be clutch by invisible , huge finger .
he arms drop stiffly to he side , he lip sag open , and a dull , imbecilic light came into he eyes .
there be a little foam on he lip .
he whole body twitch like a wooden dance figure on a string .
<p>
captain Morgan fire .
<p>
for a moment the cockney seem to grow small .
he shoulder draw in until they nearly cover he chest , like short wing .
he hands clench , and then the whole contract mass fell to the ground , convulse like a thick , animate jelly .
he lip draw back from he tooth in a last idiot snarl .
<p>
Henry Morgan stir the body with he foot , and a change stir in he mind .
he have kill this man .
It be he right to kill , to burn , to plunder not because he be ethical nor even because he be clever , but because he be strong .
Henry Morgan be the master of Panama and all it people .
there be no will in Panama save Henry Morgan's will .
he could slaughter every human in the country if he so chose .
all this be true .
No one would deny it .
but in the palace back there be a woman who hold he power and he will in contempt , and she contempt be a strong weapon than he will .
she fence at he embarrassment and touched he at she convenience .
but how could that be ? he argue .
No one be master in Panama but she , and he have just kill a man to prove it .
under the batter of he argument the power of Ysobel wane and slowly disappear .
he would go back to the palace .
he would force she as he have promise .
this woman have be treat with too much consideration .
she do not realize the significance of slavery , nor do she know the iron of Henry Morgan .
<p>
he turn about and walk back toward the palace .
in the hall of audience he throw off he pistol , but the grey rapier remain at he side .
<p>
Ysobel be kneel before a holy picture in she little whitewash cell when Henry Morgan burst upon she .
the dry duenna shrink into a corner at the sight of he , but Ysobel regard he intently , noted he flush face , he half-closed , fierce eyes .
she hear he heavy breathing , and with a smile of comprehension rose to she foot .
she laughter ring banteringly as she draw a pin from she bodice and assumed the position of a fencer , one foot forward , she left arm hold behind she for balance , the pin pointed before she like a foil .
<p>
 " en garde ! " she cry .
then the captain rush at she .
he arms encircle she shoulder and he hands be tearing at she clothing .
Ysobel stand quite still , but one hand dart about with it pin-striking , striking-like a small white serpent .
little spot of blood appear on Henry cheek , on he throat .
<p>
 " you eyes next , captain , " she say quietly , and stab he thrice on the cheekbone .
Henry release she and step away , wipe he bloody face with the back of he hand .
Ysobel laugh at he .
A man may beat-may subject to every violation-a woman who cry and run away , but he be helpless before one who stand she ground and only laugh .
<p>
 " I hear a shot , " she say .
 " I think perhaps you have kill some one to justify you manhood .
but you manhood will suffer now , will it not ?
word of this encounter will get about somehow ; you know how such thing travel .
It will be tell that you be beat with a pin in the hands of a woman . "
she tone be gloat and cruel .
<p>
Henry hand slip to he side , and the lean rapier creep from it sheath like a freeze serpent .
the light lick viciously along it lank blade .
at last the needle point came out , and the steel turn and pointed at the woman breast .
<p>
Ysobel grow sick with terror .
 " I be a sinner , " she say .
then a dawn relief came into she face .
she motion the aged duenna to she and spoke in rapid , clatter Spanish .
<p>
 " It be true , " say the old woman .
 " It be true . "
<p>
at the end of she speaking , Ysobel thriftily draw aside the webby lace of she mantilla that it might not be spotted with blood .
the duenna begin interpret .
<p>
 " sir , I mistress say that a true Catholic who die at the hand of an infidel go to heaven .
this be true .
further , she say that a Catholic woman who die protect she holy marriage vow go straightway to heaven .
this also be true .
lastly , she think that such a woman might , in course of time , be canonize .
such thing have happen .
ah , sir !
captain , be kind !
permit I to kiss she hand , now , before you strike .
what grace to have kiss the hand of a living saint !
It may do much for I own sinful soul . "
<p>
Ysobel spoke to she again .
<p>
 " I mistress bid you strike ; more , she urge it , plead for the blow .
the angel be hover about she head .
she see the great light , and the holy music be sounding in she ear . "
<p>
the rapier point lower .
Henry Morgan turn away and gaze out into the sunlit garden .
little chico came galloping along the path and sit down in the open doorway .
the little beast clasp he paw and raise them above he head as though in prayer .
the lean rapier make a sharp swish sound as it drive into it scabbard .
And captain Morgan stoop to pick up the tiny monkey .
he walk away stroke chico head with he forefinger .
<p>
1 . 4 . 5 V
Henry Morgan lift a golden cup from the heap of loot .
It be a lovely , slender chalice with long curve handle and a rim of silver .
around it outer edge four grotesque lamb chase each other , and inside , on the bottom , a naked girl lift she arms in sensual ecstasy .
the captain turn the cup in he hands .
then , suddenly , he hurl it at a little fiery pyramid of diamond .
the stone scatter from they neat pile with a dry , rustle sound .
Henry Morgan turn and go back to he serpent chair .
he be thinking of the little cockney , Jones ; thinking of the cold hand of epilepsy which have seize he in he last moment of life .
the hand have be always behind he , a giant hand to wring the man body until the white drops of agony ooze from he lip .
Henry wonder , now , why he have want to hurt the little man , to torture he , and finally to kill he .
Jones have be shadow through all he life by a sleepless tormentor .
of course , this murder have be cause by the word of Coeur de Gris who have say that Jones be like Henry Morgan .
yes , he know it now , and he know , also , a red shame for he trump charge of thievery .
why could he not have kill the man without explanation ?
<p>
And Coeur de Gris-where be he now ?
he have see Ysobel-that be fairly sure and she have notice he .
perhaps she love Coeur de Gris , with he bright hair and he curious way with woman .
And how could he keep this young man from knowing he defeat , from hearing the adventure of the pin and all the ignominy of Henry Morgan's dealings with La Santa Roja ?
the pistol which have kill Jones be lie on the floor .
Henry pick it up and methodically go to loading it .
he do not fear ridicule from Coeur de Gris , but rather sympathy and understanding .
Henry do not want understanding now .
he lieutenant would look at he with compassion and some pity ; and there would be something superior about the pity , something faintly ironic .
It would be the pity of a young , handsome man who condone the amorous failure of one not so handsome .
And then , Coeur de Gris be something like a woman for knowing thing-something like Ysobel .
he gather information with a mysterious hide eye .
<p>
And the Red saint .
Henry musth take she away with he , of course .
he could do nothing else .
perhaps , after a long time , she would fall in love with he , but not , surely , because of merits in she .
she contempt have convince he that he have no merits ; that he be a monstrous be , set apart from other man by unmentionable ugliness .
she have not say so much , but she have intimate it .
No , he have not the quality like to draw a woman to he side when there be other man about .
but perhaps , if she saw no other man , she might ignore the quality so lack in he .
she might come , at last , to build on something he possessed .
<p>
he think of the last scene with she .
now that he be calm , he wild action seem the showing off of a thick-legged little boy .
but how could any man have done otherwise ?
she have beat assault with laughter-sharp , cruel laughter which take he motive out and make sport of them .
he might have kill she ; but what man could kill a woman who want to be kill , who beg to be kill ?
the thing be impossible .
he ram a bullet into the muzzle of he pistol .
<p>
A draggle , unkempt figure came through the doorway .
It be Coeur de Gris , a red-eyed , mud-spatter Coeur de Gris with the blood of the battle still on he face .
he look at the heap of treasure .
<p>
 " we be rich , " he say without enthusiasm .
<p>
 " where have you be , Coeur de Gris ? "
<p>
 " be ?
'Why , I have be drunk .
It be good to be drunk after fight . "
he smile wryly and lick he lip " It be not so good to stop be drunk .
that be like childbirth-necessary , but unpleasant and unornamental . "
<p>
 " I want you by I side , " say Henry Morgan .
<p>
 " you want I ?
I be informed that you want no one-that you be quite complete and happy in she-and so I get a little drunk .
you see , sir , I do not want to remember you reason for be alone . "
he pause .
 " It be tell I , sir , that the Red saint be here . "
Coeur de Gris laugh at he own ill-conceal emotion .
he change he manner with an effort of will .
he tone become jocular .
<p>
 " tell I the truth , sir .
It be a small gift to a man to know what he have miss .
many people have no other gift during they whole live .
tell I , sir , have the sweet enemy fall ?
have the castle of flesh capitulate ?
do the standard of Morgan float over the pink tower ? "
<p>
Henry face have flush .
the pistol in he hand rose quietly , steady by an inexorable madness .
there be a sharp crash and a white billow of smoke .
<p>
Coeur de Otis stand as he be .
he seem to be intently listen to some distant , throb sound .
then a grimace of terror spread on he face .
he finger frantically explore he breast and follow a trickle of blood to it source , a small hole in he lung .
the little finger edge into the hole .
Coeur de Gris smile again .
he be not afraid of certain thing .
now that he know , he be not frighten any more .
<p>
captain Morgan stare stupidly at the pistol in he hand .
<p>
he seem surprise to discover it there , startle at it presence .
<p>
Coeur de Gris laugh hysterically .
<p>
 " I mother will hate you , " he cry ruefully .
 " she will practice all she ancient curse upon you .
I mother " he choke over he breath .
 " do not tell she .
make some gleam lie .
build I poor life up to a golden minaret .
do not let it stop like a half-finished tower .
but , no-you need build only a foundation .
if you give she that , she will continue the structure of heroic memory .
she will make for I a tomb of white , inaccurate thought . "
he throat fill with blood .
 " why do you do it , sir ? "
<p>
the captain look up from he pistol .
<p>
 " do it ? "
he saw the bloody lip , the tear breast ; he start up from he chair and then fell back again .
misery be writing lines about he eyes .
 " I do not know , " he say .
 " I musth have known , but I have forget . "
<p>
Coeur de Gris go slowly to he knee .
he steady she with he knuckle on the floor .
 " It be I knee , sir ; they will not bear I any more , " he apologize .
he seem to be listen for the throb sound again .
suddenly he voice rose in bitter complaint .
<p>
 " It be a legend that dye man think of they deed done .
No No-I think of what I have not done-of what I might have done in the year that be dye with I .
I think of the lip of woman I have never see-of the wine that be sleep in a grape seed-of the quick , warm caress of I mother in Goaves .
but mostly I think that I shall never walk about again-never , never stroll in the sunshine nor smell the rich essence the full moon conjure up out of the earth sir , why do you do it ? "
<p>
Henry Morgan be stare at the pistol again .
 " I do not know , " he mutter sullenly .
 " I musth have known , but I have forget .
I kill a dog once-and I have just kill Jones .
I do not know why . "
<p>
 " you be a great man , captain , " Coeur de Gris say bitterly .
 " great man may leave they reason for the creative band of they apologist .
but I-why , sir , I be nothing any more-nothing .
A moment ago I be an excellent swordsman ; but now , I be-that which fight , and cursed , and love-it may never have be , for all I know . "
he wrist weaken and he fell to he side and lay there cough at the obstruction in he throat .
then , for a time , there be no sound in the room save he uneven gasp for breath .
but suddenly he raise she on one elbow and laugh ; laugh at some cosmic joke , some jest of the great rolling sphere ; laugh triumphantly , as though he have solve a puzzle and found how simple it be .
A wave of blood ride to he lip on the laughter , and fill up he throat .
the laugh become a gush sigh , and Coeur de Gris sink slowly to he side and be still , because he lung would no longer force breath .
<p>
Henry still stare at the pistol in he hand .
slowly he raise he eyes to the open window .
the stream ray of the sun make the treasure on the floor glow like a mass of hot metal .
he eyes wander to the body in front of he .
he shudder .
And then he go to Coeur de Gris , pick he up , and sit he in a chair .
the limp body fell over to one side .
Henry straighten it and brace it in an upright position .
then he go back to he serpent chair .
<p>
 " I raise I hand like this " he say , pointing the pistol at Coeur de Gris .
 " I raise I hand like this .
I musth have .
Coeur de Gris be dead .
like this , I raise it-like this-and pointed do I do it ? "
he bow he head , then raise it with a chuckle .
<p>
 " Coeur de Gris ! " he say ; " Coeur de Otis !
I want to tell you about La Santa Roja .
she ride horse , you know .
she have no womanly modesty at all none at all-and she look be only moderate . "
he peer at the prop figure before he .
the eyes of Coeur de Gris have be only half closed , but now the lid slip down and the eyes begin to sink back in he head .
on he face be the freeze distortion of he last bitter laughter .
<p>
 " Coeur de Gris ! " the captain shout .
he go quickly to the body and lay he hand on it forehead .
<p>
 " this be a dead thing , " he say musingly .
 " this be only a dead thing .
It will bring fly and sickness .
I musth have it take away at once .
It will bring the fly into this room .
Coeur de Gris ! we have be fool .
the woman fence like a man , and she ride horse astride .
So much labor lose for we !
That's what we get for believe everything we hear-eh , Coeur de Gris ?
-But this be only a dead thing , and the fly will come to it . "
<p>
he be interrupted by a tramp of foot on the stairs .
A band of he man enter , driving in they midst a poor frighten Spaniard-a mud-draggle , terrify Spaniard .
the lace have be tear from he neck , and a little stream of blood run from one sleeve .
<p>
 " here be a Spaniard , sir , " the leader say .
 " he came to the city bearing a white flag .
shall we respect the white flag , sir ?
he have silver on he saddle .
shall we kill he , sir ?
perhaps he be a spy . "
<p>
Henry Morgan ignore the speech .
instead he pointed to the body in the chair .
<p>
 " that be only a dead thing , " he announce .
 " that be not Coeur de Gris .
I send Coeur de Gris away .
he will be back soon .
but that be-I raise I hand like this-do you see ? -like this .
I know exactly how I do it ; I have try it again and again .
but that be a dead thing .
It will bring the fly to we . "
he cry , " oh , take it away and bury it in the earth ! "
<p>
A buccaneer move to lift the body .
<p>
 " do touch he !
do dare to touch he !
leave he where he be .
he be smile .
do you see he smile ?
but the fly-No , leave he .
I will care for he she . "
<p>
 " this Spaniard , sir ; what shall we do with he ?
shall we kill he ? "
<p>
 " what Spaniard ? "
<p>
 " why , this one before you , sir . "
he shove the man forward .
Henry seem to awaken from a deep dream .
<p>
 " what do you want ? " he ask harshly .
<p>
the Spaniard struggle with he fright .
<p>
 " It-it be I wish and the wish of I padrone to have speech with one captain Morgan if he will have the goodness .
I be a messenger , Seor-not a spy , as these-these gentleman suggest . "
<p>
 " what be you message ? "
Henry voice have become weary .
<p>
the messenger take reassurance from he change tone .
 " I come from one man very rich , seor .
you have he wife . "
<p>
 " I have he wife ? "
<p>
 " she be take in the city , seor . "
<p>
 " she name ? "
<p>
 " she be the Doa Ysobel Espinoza , Valdez y los Gabilanes , seor .
the simple people of the city have call she La Santa Roja . "
<p>
Henry Morgan regard he for a long time .
 " yes , I have she , " he say finally .
 " she be in a cell .
what do she husband wish ? "
<p>
 " he offer ransom , seor .
he have reason to wish he wife with he again . "
<p>
 " what ransom do he offer ? "
<p>
 " what would you Excellency suggest ? "
<p>
 " twenty thousand piece of eight , " Henry say quickly .
the messenger be stagger .
 " twenty thou mil " he translate fully to comprehend the enormity of the amount .
 " I perceive that you Excellency also want the woman . "
<p>
Henry Morgan look at the body of Coeur de Gris .
 " No , " he say ; " I want the money . "
<p>
now the messenger be relieved .
he have be prepare to think this great man a great idiot .
 " I will do what may be done , seor .
I will come back to you in four days . "
<p>
 " in three ! "
<p>
 " but if I do not arrive , seor ? "
<p>
 " if you do not arrive , I shall take the Red saint away with I and sell she in the slave dock . "
<p>
 " I shall strive , seor . "
<p>
 " give he courtesy ! " the captain command .
 " do not mistreat he in any way .
he be to bring we gold . "
<p>
As they be leave , one man turn back and let he eyes lovingly caress the treasure .
<p>
 " when be the division to be , sir ? "
<p>
 " in Chagres , fool !
do you think I would divide it now ? "
<p>
 " but , sir , we would like to be have a bit of it in we hands-for the feel of it , sir .
we have fight hard , sir . "
<p>
 " get out !
You'll have none of it in you hands until we come to the ship again .
do you think I want to have you throw it to the woman here ?
let the Goaves woman get it from you . "
<p>
the man go out of the hall of audience grumble a little .

the buccaneer be riot in Panama .
barrel of wine have be roll to a large warehouse .
the floor have be clear of it clutter of merchandise , and now a wild dance be in progress .
number of woman be there , woman who have go over to the pirate .
they dance and fling about to the shriek of flute as though they foot do not sound on the grave of Panama at all .
they , dear economist , be gain back some of the lose treasure , use a weapon more slow , but no less sure , than the sword .
<p>
in a corner of the warehouse sit the Burgundian and he one-armed protector .
<p>
 " see , Emil !
that one there to she she hip now ! "
<p>
 " I see she , 'Toine , and it be good of you .
do not think I do not appreciate you trouble for I pleasure .
but I be silly enough to have an ideal , even in copulation .
this prove to I that I be still an artist , if not a gentleman . "
<p>
 " but see , Emil .
notice for a moment the fullness of she bosom . "
<p>
 " No , 'Toine ; I see nothing that endanger I rose pearl .
I will keep it by I a while yet . "
<p>
 " but really , I friend , I think you lose you sense of beauty .
where be that careful eye we used to fear so on we canvas ? "
<p>
 " the eye be here , 'Toine .
It be still here .
It be you own little eye which make nymph of brown mares . "
<p>
 " Then , Emil , since you persist in you blindness , perhaps you would condescend to loan I you rose pearl .
There-I thank you .
I shall return it presently . "
<p>
Grippo be seat in the middle of the floor , sullenly count the buttons on he sleeve .
<p>
 " -eight , nine be ten .
some bastard have steal I button .
ah , this world of thieve !
It be too much .
I would kill for that button .
It be I favourite button .
one , two , three there be ten .
one , two , three , four " about he the dancer rock and the air be reek with the shrill cry of the flute .
<p>
captain Sawkins glower at the dancer .
he firmly believe that to dance be to go to hell by a short route .
beside he , captain Zeigler sadly watch the flow of liquor .
this Zeigler be call the tavern keeper of the sea .
It be he practice , after a raid , to keep the man at sea until they have spend they plunder buy the rummy which he supply .
once he have a mutiny , it be say , because for three month he sail around and around one island .
he could not help it .
the man still have money and he still have rummy .
this night he be sadden by these barrel of liquor which be be drunk without any obbligato of coin ring on the counter .
It be unnatural to he and mischievous .
<p>
Henry Morgan be sitting alone in the hall of audience .
he could barely hear the crying music of the dance .
throughout the day little band of man have come in , bearing bit of belated treasure dig from the earth or drawn with iron hook from the cistern .
one old woman have swallow a diamond to save it , but the searcher dig for that , too , and found it .
<p>
now a grey twilight be in the hall of audience .
all through the day Henry Morgan have be sitting in he tall chair , and the day have change he .
he eyes , those peer eyes which have look out over a living horizon , be turn inward .
he have be look at she , look perplexedly at Henry Morgan .
in the year of he life and of he adventure , he have believe so completely in he purpose , whatever it may have be at the moment , that he have give the matter little think .
but today he have considered she , and , in the grey twilight , he be bewilder at the sight of Henry Morgan .
Henry Morgan do not seem worthy , or even important .
those desire and ambition toward which he have bay across the world like a scent hound , be shabby thing now he look inward at she .
And wonderment like the twilight be about he in the hall of audience .
<p>
As he sit in the half dark , the wrinkle duenna creep in and stand before he .
she voice be like the crumple of paper .
<p>
 " I lady wish to speak with you , " she say .
<p>
Henry rose and walk heavily after she toward the cell .
A candle be burning before the holy picture on the wall .
the Madonna re-present be a fat , Spanish peasant , holding a flabby child at which she look with sad astonishment .
the priest who paint it mean to put reverence on she face , but he have so little experience with reverence .
he have be successful , however , in making it a good portrait of he dull mistress and he child .
four reales , the picture bring he .
<p>
Ysobel sit under the picture .
when Henry enter she go quickly to he .
<p>
 " It be say I be to be ransom . "
<p>
 " you husband send a messenger . "
<p>
 " I husband !
I be to go back to he ? to he scent hands ? "
<p>
 " yes . "
<p>
she pointed to a chair and forced Henry to seat she .
 " you do not understand I , " she say .
 " you could not understand I .
you musth know something of the life I have travel .
I musth tell you this thing , and then you will understand I , and then "
she await he interest .
Henry be silent .
<p>
 " do you wish to hear this thing ? " she ask .
<p>
 " yes . "
<p>
 " well , it be short .
I life have be short .
but I want you to understand I , and then "
she look sharply into he face .
Henry mouth be pinch as though in pain .
he eyes contemplate bewilderment .
he make no reply to she pause .
<p>
 " It be this way , you see , " she begin .
 " I be born here in Panama , but I parent send I to Spain when I be a small child .
I live in a convent in Cordova .
I wear grey diving and lay in watch before the virgin on I nights give to adoration .
sometimes I go to sleep when I should have be pray .
I have suffer for that laxness .
when I have be there a number of year , the bravo raid I father plantation here in Panama and kill all of I family .
I be left with no relative save one old grandfather .
I be alone , and I be sad .
I do not sleep on the floor before the virgin for a time .
<p>
 " I have grown handsome , that I know , for once a cardinal who be visit the school look at I , and he lip tremble , and the great vein stand out on he hands when I kiss he ring .
he say , 'Peace be with you , I daughter .
have you anything you would like to confess to I privately ? '
<p>
 " I hear the cry of the water seller over the wall , and I hear the scuffle of a quarrel .
once two man fight with sword in sight of I , where I stand on a stick and look over the wall .
And one night a young man bring a girl to the shadow of the gate and lay with she there within two pace of I .
I hear them whisper together , she protest she fear , and he reassure she .
I fingered I grey gown and wonder whether this boy would plead with I if he know I .
when I spoke to one of the sister about this night she say , 'it be wicked to hear such thing , and more wicked to think of them .
you musth do penance for you curious ear .
what gate do you say ? '
<p>
 " the fishmonger would cry , 'Come , little grey angel , and look on I basket of catch .
come out of you holy prison , little grey angel . '
<p>
 " one night I climb over the wall and go away from the city .
I do not mean to tell you of I journey , but only of the day when I came to Paris .
the kingbolt be riding through the street , and he equipage be glitter and gold .
I stand high on I toe in the crowd of people and watch the courtier go riding by .
then , suddenly , a dark face be thrust before I , and a strong hand take I arm .
I be lead to a doorway apart from the people .
<p>
 " see , captain ; he whip I with a thong of hard leather he have only for that purpose .
he face have something of a beast snarl hiding very near the surface .
but he be free-a bold , free , thief .
he kill before he stole always he kill .
And we live in entryways , and on the floor of church , and under the land arch of a bridge , and we be free-free from thought and free from fear and worry .
but once he go away from I , and I found he hanging by the neck on a gallows-oh , a great gallows festoon with man hanging by they neck .
<p>
 " Can you understand that , captain ?
do you see that as I saw it ?
And do it mean anything at all to you ? "
she eyes be on fire .
<p>
 " I walk back to Cordova , and I foot be tear .
I do penance until I body be tear , but I could not drive out all the devil .
I be exorcise , but the devil be deep in I .
Can you understand that , captain ? "
she look into Henry face and saw that he have not be listen .
she stand beside he and move she finger in he grey hair .
<p>
 " you be change , " she say .
 " some light be go out of you .
what fear have fall on you ? "
<p>
he stir from he reverie .
<p>
 " I do not know . "
<p>
 " I be tell that you kill you friend .
Is it that which burden you ? "
<p>
 " I kill he . "
<p>
 " And do you mourn for he ? "
<p>
 " perhaps .
I do not know .
I think I mourn for some other thing which be dead .
he might have be a vital half of I , which , dye , leave I half a man .
today I have be like a bound slave on a white slab of marble with the gather vivisector about I .
I be supposed to be a healthy slave , but the scalpel found I sick with a disease call mediocrity . "
<p>
 " I be sorry , " she say .
<p>
 " you be sorry ?
why be you sorry ? "
<p>
 " I think I be sorry because of you lose light , because the brave , brutal child in you be dead-the boastful child who mock and think he mockery shake the throne of God ; the confident child who graciously permit the world to accompany he through space .
this child be dead , and I be sorry .
I would go with you , now , if I think it possible to warm the child to life again . "
<p>
Henry say , " It be strange .
two days ago I plan to tear a continent out of the set order and crown it with a capital of gold for you .
in I mind , I build up an empire for you , and plan the diadem you should wear .
And now I dimly remember the person who think these thing .
he be an enigmatic stranger on a stagger globe .
<p>
 " And you-I feel only a slight uneasiness with you .
I be not afraid of you any more .
I do not want you any more .
I be fill with a nostalgia for I own black mountain and for the speech of I own people .
I be drawn to sit in a deep veranda and to hear the talk of an old man I used to know .
I find I be tire of all this bloodshed and struggle for thing that will not lie still , for article that will not retain they value in I hands . it be horrible , " he cry .
 " I do not want anything any more .
I have no lust , and I desire be dry and rattle .
I have only a vague wish for peace and the time to ponder imponderable matter . "
<p>
 " you will take no more cup of gold , " she say .
 " you will turn no more vain dream into unsatisfactory conquest .
I be sorry for you , captain Morgan .
And you be not right about the slave .
Ill he be , indeed , but not with the illness you have mention .
but I suppose you sin be great .
all man who break the bar of mediocrity commit frightful sin .
I shall pray for you to the holy virgin , and she will intercede for you at the throne of heaven .
but what be I to do ? "
<p>
 " you will go back to you husband , I suppose . "
<p>
 " yes , I will go back .
you have make I old , seor .
you have prick the dream on which I heavy spirit float .
And I wonder whether , in the year to come , you will blame I for the death of you friend . "
<p>
Henry flush quickly .
<p>
 " I be trying to do something of that sort now , " he say .
 " It do not seem worth the while to lie any more , and that be only one more proof of dead youth .
but now , good-by , Ysobel .
I wish I love you now as I think I do yesterday .
go back to you husband scent hands . "
<p>
she smile and raise she eyes to the holy picture on the wall .
 " peace go with you , dear fool , " she murmur .
 " ah , I too have lose I youth .
I be old old-for I can console she with the think of what you have miss . "
<p>
1 . 4 . 7 VII
Henry Morgan stand in the doorway of the hall of audience and watch a little troupe of Spaniard ride through the street toward the palace .
the troupe be surround on all side by a mob of buccaneer .
first in the line came the messenger , but a change messenger .
now he be dress in scarlet silk .
the plume of he hat and he sword scabbard be white in token of peace .
behind he ride six soldier in silver breast-plate and the Spanish helmet which look like half mustard seed .
the last soldier lead a riderless white mare with crimson trappings and a line of golden bell on it brow band .
the white saddle cloth nearly touched the ground .
following the mare be six mule bearing heavy leathern bags , and the group be rear-guarded by six more soldier .
<p>
the cavalcade draw up before the palace .
the messenger leap from he horse and bow to Henry Morgan .
<p>
 " I have here the ransom , " he say .
he look worry and tire .
the weight of he mission be riding heavily on he spirit .
at he command the soldier carry the leather bags into the hall of audience , and only when they be all deposit with the rest of the treasure do the anxiety leave he face .
<p>
 " ah , " he say , " it be good .
It be the treasure .
twenty thousand piece of eight-not one lose by the wayside .
I invite you to count them , seor . "
he whip a little dust from he foot .
 " if I man could have refreshment , seor ; wine " he suggest .
<p>
 " yes .
yes . "
Henry motion to one of he follower .
 " see that these man have food and drink .
be courteous , as you love life . "
<p>
then he go to the bags to count the ransom .
he make little tower of shine coin and move the tower about on the floor .
money be bright , he think .
It could have be cut in no more charming shape , either .
A square would not answer , nor an ellipse .
And money be really worth more than money .
he tumble a tower and build it up again .
It be so extremely certain-money .
one know beforehand what it would do if set in motion ; at least , he know up to a certain point .
beyond that point it do not matter what it accomplished .
one might buy wine with money .
one have the wine .
And if the merchant clerk should kill he master for the same coin , it be unfortunate ; it be , perhaps , fate or something like that , but one have he wine just the same .
<p>
And all this pile of golden vessel , these crosslet and candlestick and pearl vestment , would be money like this .
these bar of gold and silver would be cut into round flake and each flake stamp with a picture .
the picture would be more than a picture .
like the kiss of a saint , it would endow the flake with power ; the picture would give it a character and a curious , compelling soul .
he fling the coin into a heap and patiently set about to rebuild them .
enough tower for Jerusalem !
<p>
now Ysobel came from the patio and stand beside he .
<p>
 " what an amount of money , " she say .
 " Is that I ransom ? "
<p>
 " yes ; it be the gold which purchase you . "
<p>
 " but what a very great deal !
Am I worth that much , do you think ? "
<p>
 " to you husband you be .
he pay it for you . "
he move ten tower into a line .
<p>
 " And to you-how much ?
how many of these golden chip ? "
<p>
 " you musth have be worth that much to I .
I stated the price . "
<p>
 " would they skip well on the water ! " she say .
 " how they would skip !
do you know , I can throw like a boy , with I arm bent . "
<p>
 " It be say you be capable , " he announce .
<p>
 " but be I really worth that much ? "
<p>
 " the money be here , and you be to go .
It have buy you .
A thing musth be worth what be pay for it , or there could be no trade . "
<p>
 " It be good , " she say .
 " It be comforting to know one value to a real .
have you any idea of you worth , captain ? "
<p>
Henry Morgan say , " if I be ever capture and a ransom demand for I , I would not be worth a copper penny .
these dog of mine would laugh and shrug .
A new captain would raise to lead them , and I-well , I would be subject to the pleasure of I captor , and I think I could foretell they pleasure .
you see , I have be at revalue she in the last few days .
I may have some value to historian because I have destroy a few thing .
the builder of you cathedral be forget even now , but I , who burned it , may be remember for a hundred year or so .
And that may mean something or other about mankind . "
<p>
 " but what be there about I that be worth all this gold ? " she insist .
 " Is it I arms , do you suppose ?
I hair ?
or be it that I be the embodiment of I husband vanity ? "
<p>
 " I do not know , " say Henry .
 " with the revaluation of she , the whole economic system of emotion and person have change .
today , be I to demand a ransom , perhaps you would not be flatter . "
<p>
 " do you so hate I , captain Morgan ? "
<p>
 " No , I do not hate you ; but you be one of the star of I firmament which have prove to be a meteor . "
<p>
 " that be not gallant , sir .
that be quite different from you speech of a few days past , " she observe spitefully .
<p>
 " No .
It be not gallant .
I think that hereafter I shall be gallant for two reason only-money and advancement .
I try to be gallant for the pure , joyous look of thing .
you see , I be honest with she before and I be honest with she now .
these two honesty be antithetical . "
<p>
 " you be bitter . "
<p>
 " No ; I be not even bitter .
the food that bitterness feed on be go out of I . "
<p>
 " I be going now , " she say softly and wistfully .
 " have you nothing more to say to I about she ?
nothing more to ask of I ? "
<p>
 " nothing , " he answer , and immediately go to piling the coin again .
<p>
the messenger enter from the street .
he have drunk deeply , for the removed burden of he mission have make he joyous .
he bow to Ysobel and to Henry Morgan ; bow warily , with an eye to he balance .
<p>
 " we musth go , seor , " he announce loudly .
 " the way be long . "
he lead Ysobel to the white mare and help she into the saddle .
then , at he signal , the column move off down the street .
Ysobel look back once as they start , and it seem that she have take a mood from Henry Morgan , for there be a puzzle smile on she lip .
but then she bent she head over the mare neck ; she be intently study the mare white mane .
<p>
the messenger have remain standing at Henry side in the doorway .
together they watch the fluid line of rider swing away while the sunlight glint on the soldier armour .
in the center of the troupe , the white mare seem a pearl in a setting of silver .
<p>
the messenger put he hand on Henry shoulder .
<p>
 " we know how to understand each other , we man of responsibility , " he say drunkenly .
 " It be not as though we be child to have secret .
we be man , brave man and strong .
we may confide in each other .
you may tell I the thing near you heart if you wish , seor . "
<p>
Henry shake the hand from he shoulder .
 " I have nothing to tell you , " he say brusquely .
<p>
 " ah ; but then I will tell you something .
perhaps you wonder why the husband of this woman be will to pay such a vast sum for she .
she be only a woman , you say .
there be many woman to be have more cheaply-some for a real or two .
she husband be a fool , you say .
but I would not have you think that of I master .
he be no fool .
I will tell you how it be .
she grandfather still live , and he be the owner of ten silver mine and fifty league of fertile land in Peru .
Doa Ysobel be the heiress .
now if she be kill or carry off you understand , Seor !
the fortune into the kingbolt arms ! "
he laugh at the cleverness of he reasoning .
 " we understand each other , seor .
we have tough skull-not the soft heads of chicken .
twenty thousand-it be nothing to be reckon against ten silver mine .
ah , yes ; we understand each other , we man of responsibility . "
<p>
he clamber into he saddle and ride away still laugh .
Henry Morgan saw he join the undulate cavalcade ; and now there be a ruby with the pearl in the silver setting .
<p>
captain Morgan go back to the treasure .
he sit on the floor and take the coin into he hands .
 " the most human of all human trait be inconsistency , " he think . " it be a shock to learn this thing , almost as great a shock to a man as the realization of he humanity .
And why musth we learn that last ?
in all the mad incongruity , the turgid stultiloquy of life , I feel , at least , securely anchor to she .
whatever the vacillation of other people , I think she terrifically constant .
but now , here I be , drag a fray line , and I anchor go .
I do not know whether the rope be cut or merely wear away , but I anchor be go .
And I be sailing around and around an island in which there be no iron . "
he let the gold piece slip through he finger .
 " but perhaps here be I iron for the making of a new anchor , " he think .
 " this be hard and heavy .
it value may fluctuate somewhat in the economic current , but at least it have a purpose , and only one purpose .
It be an absolute assurance of security .
yes , perhaps this be the one true anchor ; the one thing a man may be utterly sure of .
it claw hook tightly to comfort and security .
strangely , I have a crave for them both . "
<p>
 " but other man have a share in this gold , " part of he brain argue .
<p>
 " No , I dear conscience ; we have an end of acting now .
I have put on new glasses ; rather they have be lock about I head , and I musth order I life in accordance with the world I see through these new lens .
I see that honesty-public honesty-may be a ladder to a high , more valuable crime ; veracity a means to more subtle dissimulation .
No ; these man have no right they can enforce .
these man be too free with the right of other to deserve consideration . "
he stumble happily on the think .
 " they steal , and so shall they plunder be steal .
<p>
 " but I say I be finished with evasion and conscience drug .
what have I to do with right , now-or reason , or logic , or conscience ?
I want this money .
I want security and comfort , and I have the power between I hands to take both .
It may not be the ideal of youth , but I think it have be the world practice from the beginning .
luckily , perhaps , the world be not operate by youth .
And besides , " he say , " these fool of man do not deserve any of it .
they would be throw it away in the brothel when we came home again . "
<p>
1 . 4 . 8 VIII
the buccaneer go out of ruin Panama .
they carry all of the treasure with them across the isthmus on the back of mule .
when at last Chagres be reach , they be exhaust ; nevertheless , the following day be set for the division of spoils .
in order that this might be facilitate , the whole of the treasure be store in one ship , the great galleon which have be command by a duke before the pirate capture it .
from this center the plunder be to be divided .
captain Morgan be in good spirit .
the journey be over , he tell the man , and it be time for pleasure .
he roll out forty keg of rummy onto the beach .
<p>
early in the morning , a sleepy pirate open he red eyes and look toward the sea .
he saw the water where the galleon have be .
he call he comrade , and in a moment the shore be line with disappointed man who wistfully search the horizon .
the galleon have put to sea during the night , and all the wealth of Panama have go with she .
<p>
there be rage amongst the buccaneer .
they would give chase ; they would run down the fugitive and torture captain Morgan .
but they could not pursue .
the other ship be worthless .
some lay on the sandy bottom with great hole punch in they side ; of other , the mast be saw nearly through .
<p>
then there be curse and violence on the beach .
they swear brotherhood in the name of revenge .
they plan the horror of the retribution .
And they scatter .
some starve ; some be torture by the Indian .
the Spaniard catch and strangle some of them , and England virtuously hang a few .
<p>
1 . 5 chapter V
1 . 5 . 1 I
A multifarious population be crowded on the beach at Port royal .
they have come to see the captain Morgan who have plunder Panama .
great ladies , dress in the silken stuff of China , be there because , after all , Henry Morgan came of a good family-the nephew of the poor dear Lieutenant governor who be kill .
sailor be there because he be a sailor ; little boy because he be a pirate ; young girl because he be a hero ; business man because he be rich ; gangue of slave because they have a holiday .
there be prostitute with berry juice squeeze on they lip , and with restless eyes searching the face of unaccompanied man ; and there be girl child who hearts mother the sacred little hope that the great man might just possibly look in they direction and find the understanding he musth crave .
<p>
in the crowd be sailor who pride lay in the fact that they have hear captain Morgan curse ; tailor who have fitted breeches to he leg .
each man who have see Henry Morgan and have hear he speak , collected a group of admirer .
these lucky one have take a bit of greatness from the contact .
<p>
the Negro slave , free from they field work on this day of interest and rejoice , gaze with huge , vacuous eyes at the galleon riding in the harbour .
plantation owner stride about amongst the people , talk loudly of what they would say to Henry Morgan when they have he out to dinner , and what they would advise he .
they spoke lightly and carelessly of he , as though it be they constant practice to entertain plunderer of Panama .
certain tavern keeper have broach cask of wine on the beach from which they give freely to all who ask .
they gain would come later , with the thirst they only whet .
<p>
on a small pier wait the party of the governor ; handsome young man in lace and silver buckle , with a squad of pikeman to give them an official appearance .
the sea fan delicate , unbreaking wave on the beach .
It be late morning , and the sun a glaring crucible in the sky , but no one feel the heat ; the people have eyes and feeling for nothing but the tall galleon riding in the harbour .
<p>
noon have come when Henry Morgan , who have be watch the beach through a glass , decided to enter the city .
he stage-craft be not merely vanity .
in the night a small boat have come alongside with the news that he might be arrest for fight the enemy of the kingbolt .
Henry think the approval of the people would weigh in he favour .
all morning he have watch the approval grow as the crowd become more and more excited .
<p>
but now he long boat be lower and the sailor take they place .
As it approach the shore , the gather mob break into yell , and then a concerted roaring cheer .
the people throw they hat , leap , dance , grimace , try to shriek conversation at one another .
at the pier , hands be extended to grasp Henry before he be out of the boat .
And immediately he have step up , the pikeman form about the official party and with weapon lower forced a rough passage amongst the fight , crane spectator .
<p>
Henry glance with apprehension at the soldier who surround he .
 " Am I under arrest ? " he ask of the cavalier who walk beside he .
<p>
 " under arrest ! "
the man laugh .
 " No !
we could arrest you if we would .
the mob would tear we to piece .
And if we do succeed in the arrest , they would rip out the stone of the jail with they finger to free you .
you do not realize what you be to these people , sir .
for days they have talk of nothing save you coming .
but the governor want to see you immediately , sir .
he could come here she for obvious reason . "
<p>
they arrive at the mansion of the governor .
<p>
 " captain Morgan , " say governor Moddyford , when they be alone , " I do know whether I news be good or bad .
word of you conquest have come to the ear of the kingbolt .
both of we be order to England . "
<p>
 " but I have a commission " Henry begin .
<p>
the fat head and shoulder of the governor shake a sad negative .
 " now I would mention the commission , captain , if I be you , even though I she do issue it .
there be clause in you commission which might get we both criticize .
As it be , we may be hang : but I do know-I do know .
of course , there be peace between Spain and England-but no good feeling , none at all .
the kingbolt be angry with we , but I think a few thousand pound distribute in the right quarters might placate he be he mad with rage .
the English people be fill with joy over the conquest .
do worry about it , captain ; certainly I do not . "
he look keenly into Henry eyes .
 " I hope , sir , that you can spare those few thousand when the time come . "
<p>
say Henry , officially , " I have try to serve the spirit of I sovereign wish , not the outward play of he politics . "
And then , " surely , sir Charles ; I have enough to buy the kingbolt favour though it cost half a million .
they say the kingbolt be a good man and a judge of fine woman , and I never know one such not to need money . "
<p>
 " there be another thing , captain , " say the governor uneasily .
 " you uncle be kill some time ago .
he daughter be here in I house .
sir Edward be nearly penniless when he die .
of course , you understand , we would like to have she stay here with we always , but I do not think she be quite happy .
I think she chafe under what she think be charity .
you will look to she welfare , of course .
sir Edward die nobly and be commend by the kingbolt , but after all the commendation of the crown can be spend . "
<p>
Henry smile .
 " I uncle would have die nobly .
I be sure this uncle of mine make every move in he life-yes , even to the paring of he nail-as though the complete peerage be look on , ready to make critical comment .
<p>
how do he die ?
making a short , fitting oration ?
or with the damned thin lip of he press together as though he disapprove of death for social reason ?
ah , that man !
he life be a fine , simple part , and he be very true to it . "
Henry spoke laughingly .
 " I hate I uncle .
I think he frighten I .
he be one of the few people I fear .
but tell I how he die . "
<p>
 " It be whisper that he groan once .
I trace the rumour and found that some servant have be hiding behind a curtain .
he doubtless tell of it . "
<p>
 " too bad !
too bad !
what a cruel shame it be to ruin a perfect life with an exhalation .
but now I be not afraid of he any more .
if he groan there be humanity in he , and weakness .
I despise he , but I love he for it .
As to I cousin , I shall take she off you hands , you may be sure .
I dimly remember she as a tall little girl with yellow hair-a little girl who play abominably on the harp ; at least it sound abominable to I , though it may have be quite good . "
<p>
Moddyford came to a subject he have be wanting to broach .
<p>
 " I have hear that you meet the Red saint in Panama and release she for a ransom .
how do that happen ?
she be say to be the pearl of the earth . "
<p>
Henry redden .
<p>
 " oh , well , " he say , " it seem to I that the legend flatter she .
she be nice look , surely ; and I do say some man would not have be strike with she .
but she be not the kind of woman I admire for she .
she be rather free in she speech , you know-spoke of thing unfeminine , in I opinion .
besides , she ride horse astride , and fence .
in short , she be without that modesty we have come to look for in well-bred woman . "
<p>
 " but as a mistress surely , as a mistress ? "
<p>
 " well , you see , I receive seventy-five thousand piece of eight for she .
to I mind that be worth more than any woman who be ever born . "
<p>
 " that much ransom ?
how do she happen to bring so much ? "
<p>
 " why , on investigation , I found that she be an heiress .
And as I say , she be nice look , but still-the legend flatter she . "
<p>
meanwhile , in another room lady Moddyford be earnestly talk to Elizabeth .
<p>
 " I find I musth speak to you as a mother , I dear , a mother who be look to you future .
there be absolutely no doubt that you cousin will look out for you ; but would you be happy that way ? -just hanging to he purse string , I mean ?
look at he in another light .
he be rich , well-favour .
you understand , I dear , that it be impossible to be delicate about this , and I do not know that it would be desirable even if it be possible .
why do you marry you cousin ?
if nothing else came of it , you would be the one woman on earth who could not criticize she husband relative . "
<p>
 " but what be you suggest , lady Moddyford ? "
Elizabeth put in meekly .
 " be it some kind of crime to marry one cousin ? "
<p>
 " not a bit of it , I dear .
there be nothing in church or state to forbid it , and I , she , would favour such a marriage .
sir Charles and you cousin have be order to England .
sir Charles think a knighthood might be arrange .
then you would be lady Morgan , and you would be rich . "
<p>
Elizabeth muse : " I only saw he once , for a moment , and then I do think I quite like he .
he be excited and red .
but he be very respectful and gentle .
I think he want to be friend with I , but I father-you know how papa be .
perhaps he would make a good husband , " she say .
<p>
 " I dear , any man make a good husband if he be properly look after . "
<p>
 " yes , it might be the good way out .
I be tire of be pity for I poverty .
but with this new popularity , do you think he would notice I ?
he might be too proud to marry a penniless cousin . "
<p>
 " dear Elizabeth , " lady Moddyford say firmly , " do you know by now that almost any woman can marry almost any man as long as some other woman do interfere ?
And I shall arrange matter so that no one will get in you way .
you may trust I for that . "
<p>
Elizabeth have make up she mind .
 " I know ; I shall play for he .
I have hear how music affect these fierce man .
I shall play he I new piece elf concourse , ' and 'God bear the weary soul to rest . '
 "
 " No , " break in lady Moddyford .
 " No , I would do that if I be you .
he might not like fine music .
there be good way . "
<p>
 " but you say those piece be very pretty ; you say it she .
And have I read how music soothe man until they can hardly bear it ? "
<p>
 " Very well , I dear ; play for he , then , if you will .
perhaps he play for he .
such thing may run in the family-the love of music , I mean .
of course , you know , you musth admire he and at the same time be a little afraid of he .
make he feel that you be a poor , helpless little creature completely hem in with tiger .
but you musth arrange it in you own way .
you have a good start , for you may appeal to he for protection from the beginning . "
she sigh , " I do know what we should do without protection .
I do know when sir Charles would have propose to I .
the dear be frighten out of he life to begin .
one afternoon we sit on a bench and I positively search the landscape for something to frighten I .
we musth have be there three hours before a little water-snake amble along the path and terrify I into he arms .
No , I can think what we should do without protection .
sir Charles have a man in the garden all the time look for snake .
And do you know , I have always like snake .
I have three of them for pet when I be a little girl . "
<p>
the next morning lady Moddyford bring them together , and , as soon as she gracefully could , left them alone .
<p>
Elizabeth look fearfully at she cousin .
<p>
 " you have done great , terrible thing on the ocean , captain Morgan-enough to freeze one thinking about them , " she say falteringly .
<p>
 " the deed be not great , nor very dreadful .
nothing be as good or as bad as the telling of it . "
<p>
And he think , " I be wrong about she-very wrong .
she be not supercilious at all .
It musth have be she father-the devil-who give I a wrong impression of she .
she be quite nice . "
<p>
 " I be sure yours be great , if you modesty would let you admit it , " she be saying demurely .
 " do you know , I used to tremble at the tales they tell of you , and hope that you be not in need or trouble . "
<p>
 " do you ?
why do you ?
I do think you ever notice I . "
<p>
she eyes have fill with tears .
 " I have have trouble , too . "
<p>
 " I know .
they tell I about you trouble , and I be sorry for you , little cousin Elizabeth .
I hope you will let I help you in you trouble .
will you sit here beside I , Elizabeth ? "
<p>
she look shyly at he .
 " I'll play for you , if you like , " she say .
<p>
 " Ye-es-yes , do . "
<p>
 " now this be 'The elf concourse . '
listen !
you can hear they little foot patter on the grass .
everybody say it be very sweet and pretty . "
she finger methodically worked at the string .
<p>
Henry think she hands lovely as they fly about .
he forget about the music in watch she hands .
they be like little white moth , so delicate and restless .
one would hesitate in touching them because handling might ruin them , and yet one want to stroke them .
the piece be ending with loud bass notes .
now it be finished .
when the last string have cease it vibration , he observe : " you play very-precisely , Elizabeth . "
<p>
 " oh , I play the notes as they come , " she say .
 " I always think the composer know he business good than I do . "
<p>
 " I know , and it be a comfort to hear you .
It be nice to know that everything be to be in it place-even notes .
you have eradicate a certain obnoxious freedom I have notice in the play of some young woman .
that kind be very lovable and spontaneous and human , of course , but give to carelessness in the interest of passion .
yes , as I become old , I grow to be taking satisfaction in seeing the thing I expect come about .
unsure thing be distracting .
chance have not the tug on I it once have .
I be a fool , Elizabeth .
I go sailing and sailing look for something-well , something that do not exist , perhaps .
And now that I have lose I unnamable desire , I may not be happy , but there be more content on I . "
<p>
 " that sound wise and worldly , and a little bit cynical , " she observe .
<p>
 " but if it be wisdom , then wisdom be experience beating about in an orderly brain , kick over the file .
And how could I be otherwise than worldly .
And cynicism be the moss which collect on a rolling stone . "
<p>
 " that be clever , anyway , " she agreed .
 " I suppose you have known a great many of those young woman you spoke of . "
<p>
 " what young woman , Elizabeth ? "
<p>
 " the one who play badly . "
<p>
 " oh !
yes , I have meet a few . "
<p>
 " And do you-do you-like them ? "
<p>
 " I tolerate them because they be friend of I friend . "
<p>
 " do any of them fall in love with you ?
I know I be not delicate , but you be I cousin , and almost I-I brother . "
<p>
 " oh , some say they do-but I suspect they want I money . "
<p>
 " surely not !
but I shall play for you again .
this will be a sad piece bear the weary soul to rest . '
I always think it be good to have seriousness with the lighter music . "
<p>
 " yes , " he say .
 " yes ; so it be . "
<p>
again she finger worked over the string .
<p>
 " It be very beautiful , and sad , " say Henry , when it be finished .
 " I like it wonderfully well , but do you think , Elizabeth-do you think that sixth string from the end might be a little-tight ? "
<p>
 " oh , I would have it touched for the world ! " she cry .
 " before we came out from England , papa have a man-a harp man-go over the whole thing thoroughly .
I would feel just right with papa if it be tamper with .
he hate people who fiddle with thing . "
<p>
they sit silently after she outburst , but at length she look pleadingly into he eyes .
 " you be angry with I about the string , be you , cousin Henry ?
I just have deep feeling like that .
I can help it . "
<p>
 " No , of course I be not angry . "
she be so little and so helpless , he think .
<p>
 " where will you be going , now that you be rich and famous and cover with honours ? "
<p>
 " I do know .
I want to live in an atmosphere of sure thing . "
<p>
 " why , that's just the way I think , " she exclaim .
 " we musth be somewhat alike .
thing come to you if you do not go look for them , I say .
And nearly always I know what be going to happen to I , because I hope for it and then sit still . "
<p>
 " yes , " say Henry .
<p>
 " papa death be a great shock , " she say , and again the tears be in she eyes .
 " It's a terrible thing to be left alone and nearly no-no relative or friend .
of course , the Moddyfords have be lovely to I , but they could be like I own people .
oh , dear !
I have be so lonely .
I be glad when you came , cousin Henry , if only because we be of one blood . "
she eyes be glisten with tears , and she underlip tremble violently .
<p>
 " but you musth not cry , " Henry say soothingly .
 " you will not need to worry any more , Elizabeth .
I be here to take you trouble from you shoulder .
I will help you and care for you , Elizabeth .
I wonder how you bore the grief that fell on you .
you have be brave to hold you head so high when misery be tug at you spirit . "
<p>
 " I have I music , " she say .
 " I could retire into I music when the grief be too bitter . "
<p>
 " but now , Elizabeth , you need not even do that .
you will come with I to England when I go , and you will be comfortable and safe with I for always . "
<p>
she have spring away from he .
<p>
 " but what be you suggest ?
what be this thing you be propose to I ? " she cry .
 " be it some sin-some crime-for cousin to marry ? "
<p>
 " marry ? "
<p>
 " oh ! "
she blush , and she eyes glitter again with she quick tears .
 " oh !
I be ashamed .
you do mean marry , do you ?
I be ashamed . "
she agitation be pitiful .
<p>
 " after all , why not ? " think Henry .
 " she be pretty ; I be sure of she family ; and besides , she be rather a symbol of this security I have be preach .
I could be sure of never doing anything very radical if she be I wife .
I really think I do want security .
And besides , " he think finished , " I really can let she suffer so . "
<p>
 " oh , surely I mean marry .
what else could you have think I mean ?
I be only clumsy and crude about it .
I have startle you and hurt you .
but , dear Elizabeth , there be no crime or sin about it .
many cousin marry .
And we know all about each other , and we family be one .
you musth marry I , Elizabeth .
truly I love you , Elizabeth . "
<p>
 " oh ! " she stammer .
 " O-oh !
I can think of it .
I mean , I be-ill ; I mean I head whirl .
you act so suddenly , Henry-so unexpectedly .
oh , please let I go .
I musth talk about it to lady Moddyford .
she will know what to say . "
<p>
1 . 5 . 2 II
kingbolt Charles the second and John Evelyn be sitting in a tiny library .
A bright fire crackle on the hearth , throw it flickerings on the book which line the wall .
on a table beside the two man be bottle and glasses .
<p>
 " I knight he this afternoon , " the kingbolt be saying .
 " he get pardon and a knighthood for two thousand pound . "
<p>
 " well , two thousand pound " murmur John Evelyn .
 " certain tradesman will , perhaps , bless he knighthood . "
<p>
 " but that's not it , John .
I could have get twenty .
he take about a million out of Panama . "
<p>
 " ah , well ; two thousand pound "
 " I order he to come in here tonight , " say the kingbolt .
 " these sailor and pirate sometimes have a tale or two worth repeat .
You'll be disappointed in he .
he be-lumpish , I think be the word .
you get the impression that a great mass be plant before you ; and he move as though he pushed this own invisible cage ahead of he . "
<p>
 " you might create a title , " John Evelyn suggest .
 " It seem wasteful to let a million get away without even trying . "
<p>
sir Henry Morgan be announce .
<p>
 " step in , sir .
step in ! "
the kingbolt saw that he have a glass of wine in he hands .
Henry seem frighten .
he gulp the wine .
<p>
 " good job of yours in Panama , " the kingbolt observe .
 " It be good to burn it now than later , and I have no doubt we should have have to do it later . "
<p>
 " I think of that when I set the torch , sire .
these hoggish Spaniard want to overrun the world . "
<p>
 " you know , captain , piracy-or , to be delicate , free-booting-have be a good thing for we , and a bad thing for Spain .
but the institution grow to be a nuisance .
I spend half of I time making excuse to the Spanish ambassador .
I be going to commission you Lieutenant of Jamaica . "
<p>
 " sire ! "
<p>
 " No thanks !
I be acting on the advice of an adage .
piracy musth be stopped now .
these man have play at little war long enough . "
<p>
 " but , sire , I she be a buccaneer .
do you want I to hang I own man ? "
<p>
 " that be what I infer , sir .
who can track them down good than you who know all they haunt ? "
<p>
 " they fight with I , sire . "
<p>
 " ah ; conscience ?
I have hear that you be able to do about as you please with you conscience . "
<p>
 " not conscience , sire , but pity . "
<p>
 " pity be misplace in a public servant or a robber .
A man may do what it be profitable to do .
you she have demonstrate two of these premises .
let we see you labor with the third , " the kingbolt say acidly .
<p>
 " I wonder if I can . "
<p>
 " if you wonder , then you can , " John Evelyn put in .
<p>
the kingbolt manner change .
<p>
 " come ! drink ! " he say .
 " we musth have life , and perhaps later , song .
tell we a tale , captain , and drink while you tell it .
wine add capital and asterisk to a good tale-a true storey . "
<p>
 " A tale , sire ? "
<p>
 " surely .
some storey of the colonial wench ; some little interlude in piracy-for I be sure you do not steal only gold . "
he motion a servant to keep Henry glass fill .
 " I have hear of a certain woman in Panama .
tell we about she . "
<p>
Henry drain he glass .
he face be becoming flush .
 " there be a tale about she , " he say .
 " she be pretty , but also she be an heiress .
I confess , I favour she .
she would inherit silver mine .
she husband offer one hundred thousand piece of eight for she .
he want to get he hands on the mine .
here be the question , sire , and I wonder how many man have be confront with one like it ?
should I get the woman or the hundred thousand ? "
<p>
the kingbolt lean forward in he chair .
 " which do you take ?
tell I quickly . "
<p>
 " I remain in Panama for a while , " say Henry .
 " what would you majesty have done in I place ?
I get both .
perhaps I get even more than that .
who know but I son will inherit the silver mine eventually . "
<p>
 " I would have done that , " cry the kingbolt .
 " you be right .
I would have done just that .
It be clever , sir .
A toast , Captain-to foresight .
you generalship , sir , run to other matter than warfare , I see .
you have never be defeat in battle , they say ; but tell I , captain , be you ever defeat in love ?
It be a good scene-an unusual scene-when a man admit she best in love .
the admission be so utterly contrary to every masculine instinct .
another glass , sir , and tell we about you defeat . "
<p>
 " not by a woman , Sire but once I be defeat by death .
there be thing which so sere the soul that the pain of it follow through life .
you ask for the storey .
you health , sire .
<p>
 " I be born in Wales , amongst the mountain .
I father be a gentleman .
one summer , while I be a lad , a little princess of France came to we mountain for the air .
she have a small retinue , and be lively and restless and clever , she achieve some freedom .
one morning I came upon she where she bath alone in the river .
she be naked and unashamed .
in an hour-such be the passionate blood of she race-she be lie in I arms .
sire , in all I wandering , in the lovely woman I have see and the town I have take , there have be no pleasure like the days of that joyous summer .
when she could escape , we play together in the hill like little god .
but this be not enough .
we want to be married .
she would give up she rank and we would go to live somewhere in America .
<p>
 " then the autumn came .
one day she say , 'They be ready to take I away , but I will not go . '
the next day she do not come to I .
in the night I go to she window and she throw a little note to I , 'I be imprison .
they have whip I . '
<p>
 " I go home .
what else could I do ?
I could not fight them , the stout soldier who guarded she .
Very late that night there be a pound on the door and cry , 'Where be a doctor to be have ?
quick !
the little princess have poison she . '
 "
Henry lift he eyes .
the kingbolt be smile ironically .
John Evelyn drum the table with he finger .
<p>
 " yes ? " say the kingbolt .
 " yes ? "
he chuckle .
<p>
 " ah , I be old-old , " Henry moan .
 " It be a lie .
she be a pleasant child , the daughter of a cottager . "
<p>
he stagger to he foot and move toward the door .
shame be burning in he face .
<p>
 " captain Morgan , you forget she . "
<p>
 " I-forget-she ? "
<p>
 " there be certain little courtesy .
custom demand that you render them to we person . "
<p>
 " I plead pardon , sire .
I plead you permission to leave .
I-I be ill . "
he bow she from the room .
<p>
the kingbolt be smile through he wine .
<p>
 " how be it , John , that such a great soldier can be such a great fool ? "
<p>
say John Evelyn , " how could it be otherwise ?
if great man be not fool , the world would have be destroy long ago .
how could it be otherwise ?
folly and distorted vision be the foundation of greatness . "
<p>
 " you mean that I vision be distorted ? "
<p>
 " No , I do not mean that . "
<p>
 " then you imply "
 " I wish to go on with Henry Morgan .
he have a knack for piracy which make he great .
immediately you imagine he as a great ruler .
you make he Lieutenant .
in this you be like the multitude .
you believe that if a man do one thing magnificently , he should be able to do all thing equally well .
if a man be eminently successful in create an endless line of mechanical doodah of some excellence , you conceive he capable of leading army or maintain government .
you think that because you be a good kingbolt you should be as good a lover-or vice . "
<p>
 " Vice ? "
<p>
 " that be a humorous alternative , sire .
It be a conversational trick to gain a smile-no more . "
<p>
 " I see .
but Morgan and he folly "
 " of course he be a fool , sire , else he would be turning soil in Wales or burrow in the mine .
he want something , and he be idiot enough to think he could get it .
because of he idiocy he do get it-part of it .
you remember the princess . "
<p>
the kingbolt be smile again .
<p>
 " I have never known any man to tell the truth to or about a woman .
why be that , John ? "
<p>
 " perhaps , sire , if you would explain the tiny scratch I see under you right eye , you could understand .
now the scratch be not there last night , and it have the distinct look of "
 " Yes-yes-a clumsy servant .
let we speak of Morgan .
you have a way , John , of be secretly insult .
sometimes you be not even conscious of you insult .
It be a thing to put down if you be to be around court for any length of time . "
<p>
1 . 5 . 3 III
sir Henry Morgan sit on the judge bench at Port royal .
before he , on the floor , lay a slab of white sunlight like a blinding tomb .
throughout the room an orchestra of fly sing they symphony of boredom .
the drone voice of counsel be only loud instrument against the hum obbligato .
court official go about sleepily , and the case move on .
<p>
 " It be the fifteenth of the month , I lord .
Williamson go to the cartwright property for the purpose of determine-determine to he own satisfaction , I lord , whether the tree stand as describe .
It be while he be there "
the case sing to it monotonous conclusion .
sir Henry , behind he broad table , stir sleepily .
now the guard bring in a sullen vagrant , clothe in rags of old sail .
<p>
 " charge with steal four biscuit and a mirror from So-and-So , I lord . "
<p>
 " the proof ? "
<p>
 " he be detect , I lord . "
<p>
 " do you , or do you not , steal four biscuit and a mirror ? "
<p>
the prisoner face become even more sullen .
<p>
 " I tell 'em . "
<p>
 " I lord , " the guard prompt .
<p>
 " I lord . "
<p>
 " why do you steal these article ? "
<p>
 " I wan'ed 'em . "
<p>
 " say I lord . "
<p>
 " I lord . "
<p>
 " what do you want with them ? "
 " I wan'ed the biscuit for to eat . "
<p>
 " I lord . "
<p>
 " I lord . "
<p>
 " And the mirror ? "
<p>
 " I wan'ed the mirror for to look at she in . "
<p>
 " I lord . "
<p>
 " I lord . "
<p>
they lead the man to he imprisonment .
now the guard bring in a thin , pasty woman .
<p>
 " charge with harlotry and incontinence , I lord . "
<p>
 " incontinence be illegal , " say sir Henry irritatedly , " but since when have we be punish people for harlotry ? "
<p>
 " I lord , the nature of this woman public health demand think the case would be understand . "
<p>
 " ah !
I see .
she musth be lock up .
take she away quickly . "
<p>
the woman begin to cry sulkily .
<p>
sir Henry rest he forehead on he hands .
he do not look up at the next prisoner .
<p>
 " charge with piracy on the high sea , I lord ; with disturb the kingbolt peace ; with an act of war against a friendly nation . "
<p>
sir Henry glance quickly at the prisoner .
one be a rotund little man with eyes of terror , and the other a lean , grizzled fellow who one arm be go .
<p>
 " what be the proof against the prisoner ? "
<p>
 " five witness , I lord . "
<p>
 " So ?
make you plea ! "
<p>
the tall man have put he good arm about the shoulder of he companion .
<p>
 " we plead guilty , I lord . "
<p>
 " you plead guilty ? "
sir Henry cry in amazement .
 " but no pirate plead guilty .
It be a case unprecedented . "
<p>
 " we plead guilty , I lord . "
<p>
 " but why ? "
<p>
 " fifty people saw we in action , I lord .
why should we take up you time in deny what fifty people will swear to ?
No , we be resigned , I lord .
we be content , both with the recent action and with we live . "
the wiry arm squeeze about the small round tub of a buccaneer .
<p>
Henry sit very silently for a time .
but finally he raise he tire eyes .
 " I sentence you to be hang . "
<p>
 " hang , I lord ? "
<p>
 " hang by the neck until you be dead . "
<p>
 " you be change , sir . "
<p>
sir Henry start forward and closely scrutinize the prisoner .
then he lip smile .
 " yes , " he say quietly , " I be change .
the Henry Morgan you know be not the sir Henry Morgan who sentence you to death .
I do not kill ferociously any more , but coldly , and because I have to . "
sir Henry raise he voice .
 " let the court be clear , but guard the door !
I wish to speak privately with the prisoner . "
<p>
when they be alone he begin : " I know well that I be change , but tell I what be the change you see . "
<p>
the Burgundians look at each other .
 " you speak , Emil . "
<p>
 " you be change , sir , in this way .
once you know what you be doing .
you be sure of she . "
<p>
 " that be so , " break in the other .
 " you do not know-you be not sure of she any more .
once you be one man .
It be possible to trust one man .
but now you be several man .
if we should trust one of you , we should be in fear of the other . "
<p>
sir Henry laugh .
 " that be more or less true .
It be not I fault , but it be true .
civilization will split up a character , and he who refuse to split go under . "
<p>
 " we have forget about civilization , thanks to we mother , " Antoine mutter fiercely .
<p>
 " what a pity to hang you . "
<p>
 " but be it so necessary to hang we , sir ?
could we not escape or be pardon ? "
<p>
 " No , you musth be hang .
I be sorry , but it musth be so .
such be I duty . "
<p>
 " but duty to you friend , sir-to the man who bore arms with you , who mixed they blood with yours "
 " listen , other Burgundian ; there be two kind of duty , and you would know that if you remember you France .
you mention one species , and it be the weak kind .
the other , the giant duty-that which will not be overlook-might be call the duty of appearance .
I do not hang you because you be pirate , but because I be expect to hang pirate .
I be sorry for you .
I would like to scend you to you cell with saw in you pocket , but I can .
As long as I do what be expect of I , I shall remain the judge .
when I change , for whatever motive , I may she be hang . "
<p>
 " that be so , sir .
I remember . "
he turn to he friend who stand shake in the grippe of horror .
 " you see , such be the case , Emil .
he do not like to tell we this thing because it hurt he .
perhaps he punish she in this manner for something he have done or fail to do .
perhaps he remember Chagres , Emil . "
<p>
 " Chagres ! "
sir Henry bent forward with excitement .
 " what happen after I sail away ?
tell I ! "
<p>
 " you be cursed , sir , as it be give to few man to be cursed .
you be torture in man mind .
they feast on you heart and send you soul to hell .
I enjoy the scene rarely , because I know that every man there envy you while he revile you .
I be proud of you , sir . "
<p>
 " And they scatter ? "
<p>
 " they scatter and die , poor little child . "
<p>
 " anyway , I should have hate to fall in with those poor little child !
tell I , " sir Henry voice have become wistful , " tell I about Panama .
we do go there , do we ?
we really capture Panama , do we , and loot it ?
It be I who lead you , wasn't it ? "
<p>
 " It be so .
It be a grand fight and an ocean of plunder-but , after all , you know more about that last than we do . "
<p>
 " sometimes I doubt whether this body ever go to Panama .
I be sure this brain do not .
I would like to stay and talk to you of that old time , but I wife expect I .
she be apt to fuss if I be late for luncheon . "
he spoke jocosely .
 " when would you like to be hang ? "
<p>
the Burgundians be whisper together .
<p>
 " ah , there be that 'hanged' again .
when would we like to be hang ?
any time , sir .
we do not wish to put you to the trouble , but if you insist-any time there be a man and a rope idle . "
Antoine approach the table .
 " Emil wish to offer one last compliment .
It be a gift for you wife-a gift the history of which alone would make it valuable .
Emil have treasure this gift to the end , and of this talisman he have reap a harvest-for talismanic it be , in truth , sir .
but Emil think it period of duty should end , sir .
he believe that by taking this means he can stop the series of event which have flow out from he treasure .
And Emil , unfortunately , will have no further use for it .
Emil kiss the hand of lady Morgan-presents he respect and dignified compliment . "
he drop a rose pearl on the table and turn quickly away .
<p>
after they have be lead out , sir Henry sit at he bench and stare at the pearl .
then he put it in he pocket and walk into the street .
<p>
he came to the squat , white palace of the Lieutenant .
It be exactly as sir Edward have left it .
lady Morgan would not have feel right if a detail have be change .
she meet Henry at the door .
<p>
 " we be to have dinner with the Vaughns .
And what be I to do about the coachman ?
He's drunk .
I've tell you and tell you to lock you closet , but you will not pay attention to I .
he sneak into the house and get a bottle off you shelf .
he musth have done that . "
<p>
 " open you hand , I dear .
I have a gift for you . "
<p>
he drop the rose pearl into she palm .
<p>
for a moment she look at the rosy sphere and she face flush with pleasure , but then she search he face suspiciously .
<p>
 " what have you be up to ? "
<p>
 " up to ?
why , I have be holding court . "
<p>
 " I suppose you get this in court ! "
she face light up .
 " I know !
you suspect I displeasure at you action last night .
you be practically intoxicate , if you musth know the truth ; and all the people be stare at you and whisper .
do say a word .
I saw them and I saw you .
And now you want to bribe I feeling-I decency . "
<p>
 " suspect you displeasure !
I dear , I suspect it all the way home with you , and nearly all night after I get here .
you be right .
I strongly suspect you displeasure .
in fact , I be certain of it .
but I will tell you the truth about the pearl . "
<p>
 " you will tell the truth only because you know you can deceive I , Henry .
when will you give up the idea that I do know every little think you possess ? "
<p>
 " but I do try to deceive you .
you do give I time . "
<p>
 " It take no more time to tell the truth than "
 " listen to I , Elizabeth , please .
I try two pirate this morning and they give it to I . "
<p>
she smile a superior smile .
 " they give it to you ?
why ?
do you release them ?
It would be like you to release them .
sometimes I think you would still be one of them if it weren't for I .
you never seem to realize , Henry , that it be really I who have make you what you be-a knight and a gentleman .
you make she a buccaneer .
but tell I , do you release these pirate ? "
<p>
 " No ; I sentence them to death . "
<p>
 " ah !
then why do they give you the pearl ? "
<p>
 " I dear , they give it to I because they have nothing else to do with it .
they might have present it to the hangman , but one would feel a trifle diffident about give pearl to the man who put a rope about one neck .
friendship be possible with one hangman , I should imagine .
thus , they give it to I , and I " he smile broadly and innocently , " I be give it to you because I love you . "
<p>
 " well , I can easily find out about the pirate , and as to you affection you love I as long as I have I eye on you , and no longer .
I know you thoroughly .
but I be glad they be hang .
lord Vaughn say they be a positive danger even to she .
he say they may stop fight Spain at any moment and start on we .
he say they be like vicious dog , to be exterminate as soon as possible .
I feel a little safe every time one of them be out of the way . "
<p>
 " but , I dear , lord Vaughn know nothing about buccaneer , while I "
 " Henry , why do you keep I here with you talk , when you know I have a thousand thing to attend to .
you think , because you have all the time in the world , that I can afford to help you idle .
now do see to the coachman , because I should be terribly embarrass if he be not fit .
he livery will not suit Jacob by any pinch .
do I tell you he be drunk ?
get he sober for tonight if you musth drown he to do it .
now hurry along .
I will feel right until I know he can sit up straight . "
she turn to re-enter the house , then came back and kiss he on the cheek .
<p>
 " It's really a nice pearl .
thank you , dear , " she say .
 " of course , I be going to have Monsieur Banzet value it .
after what lord Vaughn say , I have very little faith in pirate .
they might have be trying to bribe you with paste , and you would never know the difference . "
<p>
sir Henry walk toward the stable .
now , as on other occasions , he be gently move by uneasiness .
now and then there came a vagrant feeling that , in spite of all Elizabeth declamation to the effect that she know he thoroughly , perhaps she really do .
It be disquieting .
<p>
1 . 5 . 4 IV
sir Henry Morgan lay in an enormous bed ; a bed so wide that he body , under the coverlid , seem a snow-covered mountain range divide two great plains .
from the wall about the room the shiny eyes of he ancestor regard he .
on they face be smirk which say , " ah , yes !
A knight , to be sure-but we know how you buy you knighthood . "
the air in the room be heavy and thick and hot .
So always the air seem in a room where a man be about to die .
<p>
sir Henry be stare at the ceiling .
for an hour he have be puzzle with this mysterious ceiling .
nothing support it in the middle .
why do it not fall ?
It be late .
every one about he be silent , they go sneaking about pretend to be ghost , he think .
they be trying to convince he that he be dead already .
he closed he eyes .
he be too tire or too indifferent to keep them open .
he hear the doctor come in , and feel he reading the pulse .
then the big confident voice boom : " I be sorry , lady Morgan .
there be nothing to do now .
I do not even know what be the matter with he .
some old jungle fever , perhaps .
I could bleed he again , I suppose , but we have take a great deal of blood already , and it seem to do no good .
however , if he begin to sink , I shall try it again . "
<p>
 " then he will die ? "
lady Morgan ask .
Henry think she show more curiosity than sorrow .
<p>
 " yes , he will die unless God intervene .
only God can be sure of he patient . "
<p>
And then the room be clear of people .
Henry know that he wife be sitting near the bed .
he could hear she crying softly beside he .
 " what a pity it be , " he think , " that I can go to death in a ship so she might pack I bag for I .
It would give she so much satisfaction to know that I be enter heaven with a decent supply of clean linen . "
<p>
 " oh , I husband , Henry , I husband . "
<p>
he turn he head and look at she curiously , and he gaze go deep into she eyes .
suddenly he be seize with despair .
<p>
 " this woman love I , " he say to she .
 " this woman love I , and I have never known it .
I can know this kind of love .
she eyes-she eyes-this be something far beyond I comprehension .
Can she have love I always ? "
he look again .
 " she be very near to God .
I think woman be near to God than man .
they can talk about it , but , Christ ! how it shine in they eyes .
And she love I .
during all she hector and badger and browbeat , she have love I-and I have never known it .
but what would I have done if I have known it ? "
he turn away .
this sorrow be too great , too burning and awful to regard .
It be terrify to see a woman soul shine through she eyes .
<p>
So he be to die .
It be rather pleasant if death be like this .
he be warm and very tire .
presently he would fall asleep , and that would be death death .
<p>
he know that some other person have come into the room .
he wife lean over until she came within he up-stare vision .
she would be annoy if she know he could turn he head if he wish .
<p>
 " the vicar , dear , " he wife say .
 " do be nice to he .
oh , do listen to he !
It may help you-afterward . "
ah , she be practical !
she be going to see that some compact be make with the almighty if she could .
she affection be an efficient thing , but she love-that which glitter in she wet eyes be frightful .
<p>
Henry feel a warm , soft hand take he .
A soothe voice be talk to he .
but it be difficult to listen .
the ceiling be sway dangerously .
<p>
 " God be love , " the voice be saying .
 " you musth put you faith in God . "
<p>
 " God be love , " Henry repeated mechanically .
<p>
 " let we pray , " say the voice .
<p>
suddenly Henry remember a moment of he childhood .
he be be torture with an earache , and he mother be holding he in she arms .
she stroke he wrist with she finger tip .
 " this be all nonsense , " she be saying .
he remember how she say it .
 " this be all nonsense .
God be love .
he will not let little boy suffer .
now repeat after I lord be I shepherd .
I shall not want . '
 " It be as though she administer a medicine .
in the same tone she would have command , " come , take this oil ! "
<p>
Henry feel the warm finger of the vicar creep to he wrist and begin a stroke movement .
<p>
 " 'The lord be I shepherd .
I shall not want , ' " Henry drone sleepily .
 " 'He maketh I to lie down in green pasture "
the stroke continue , but more harshly .
the vicar voice become more loud and authoritative .
It be as though , after year of patient wait , the church have at last get Henry Morgan within it power .
there be something almost gloat about the voice .
<p>
 " have you repent you sin , sir Henry ? "
<p>
 " I sin ?
No , I have not think of them .
shall I repent Panama ? "
<p>
the vicar be embarrass .
 " well , Panama be a patriotic conquest .
the kingbolt approve .
besides , the people be papist . "
<p>
 " but what be I sin , then ? "
Henry go on .
 " I remember only the most pleasant and the most painful amongst them .
somehow I do not wish to repent the pleasant one .
It would be like breaking faith with them ; they be charming .
And the painful sin carry atonement with them like conceal knife .
how may I repent , sir ?
I might go over I whole life , name and repent every act from the shatter of I first teethe ring to I last visit to a brothel .
I might repent everything I could remember , but if I forget one single sin , the whole process would be waste . "
<p>
 " have you repent you sin , sir Henry ? "
<p>
he realize , then , that he have not be talk at all .
It be difficult to talk .
he tongue have become lazy and sluggish .
 " No , " he say .
 " I can remember them very well . "
<p>
 " you musth search in you heart for greed and lust and spite .
you musth drive wickedness from you heart . "
<p>
 " but , sir , I do remember ever have be consciously wicked .
I have done thing which seem wicked afterward , but while I be doing them I always have some rather good end in view . "
again he be conscious that he wasn't really speaking .
<p>
 " let we pray , " the voice say .
<p>
Henry make a violent effort with he tongue .
 " No ! " he cry .
<p>
 " but you pray before . "
<p>
 " yes , I pray before-because I mother would have like it .
she would have want I to pray at least once , more as a proof of she training than for any other reason , a reassurance to she that she have done she duty by I . "
<p>
 " would you die heretic , sir Henry ?
be you afraid of death ? "
<p>
 " I be too tire , sir , or too lazy , to consider problem of heresy .
And I be not afraid of death .
I have see much violence , and no man who I have admire be afraid of death , but only of dye .
you see , sir , death be an intellectual matter , but dye be pure pain .
And this death of mine be very pleasant so far .
No , sir ; I be not afraid even of dye .
It be comfortable , and it would be quiet if I could only be left alone .
It be as though I be about to sleep after a great effort . "
<p>
he hear the vicar voice again ; but , though the warm hand still stroke he wrist , the voice came from a mighty distance .
<p>
 " he will not answer I , " the vicar be saying .
 " I be perplex for he soul . "
<p>
then he hear he wife speaking to he .
 " you musth pray , dear .
every one do .
how can you get to heaven if you do not pray ? "
<p>
there she be again , intent on making a contract with God .
but Henry do not want to look at she .
nave though she philosophy be , she eyes be as deep and as sad as the limitless sky .
he want to say , " I will want to get to heaven once I be dead .
I will want them to disturb I . "
they make such a commotion about this death .
<p>
the doctor have come back into the room .
 " he be unconscious , " the boom voice proclaim .
 " I think I will bleed he again . "
<p>
Henry feel the scalpel cut into he arm .
It be pleasant .
he hope they would cut he again and again .
but the illusion be contradictory .
rather than feeling the blood leave he , he sense a curious warmth slip through he body .
he breast and arms tingle as though some robust , ancient wine be sing in he vein .
<p>
now a queer change begin to take place .
he found that he could see through he eyelid , could see all about he without moving he head .
the doctor and he wife and the vicar and even the room be sliding away from he .
<p>
 " they be moving , " he think .
 " I be not moving .
I be fixed .
I be the center of all thing and can move .
I be as heavy as the universe .
perhaps I be the universe . "
<p>
A low , sweet tone be flow into he consciousness ; a vibrant , rich organ tone , which fill he , seem to emanate from he brain , to flood he body , and from it to surge out over the world .
he saw with a little surprise that the room have go .
he be lie in an immeasurable dark grotto along the side of which be row of thick , squat column make of some green , glitter crystal .
he be still in a recline position , and the long grotto be sliding past he .
of a sudden , the movement stopped .
he be surround by strange being , have the body of child , and bulbous , heavy heads , but no face .
the flesh where they face should have be be solid and unbroken .
these being be talk and chatter in dry , raucous voice .
Henry be puzzle that they could talk without mouth .
<p>
slowly the knowledge grow in he that these be he deed and he thought which be living with brother death .
each one have go immediately to live with brother death as soon as it be born .
when he know they identity , the faceless little creature turn on he and clustered thickly about he couch .
<p>
 " why do you do I ? " one cry .
<p>
 " I do not know ; I do not remember you . "
<p>
 " why do you think I ? "
<p>
 " I do not know .
I musth have known , but I have forget .
I memory be slip away from I here in this grotto . "
<p>
still insistently they question he , and they voice be becoming more and more strident and harsh , so that they overwhelm the great tone .
<p>
 " Me ! answer I ! "
<p>
 " No ; I ! "
<p>
 " oh , leave I !
let I rest , " Henry say wearily .
 " I be tire , and I can tell you anything anyway . "
<p>
then he saw that the little being be crouch before an approach forme .
they turn toward the forme and cower , and at length fell on they knee before it and raise tremble arms in gesture of supplication .
<p>
Henry strained he attention toward the figure .
why , it be Elizabeth coming toward he-little Elizabeth , with golden hair and a wise young look on she face .
she be girdle with cornflower , and she eyes be strangely puzzle and bright .
with a little start of surprise she notice Henry .
<p>
 " I be Elizabeth , " she say .
 " you do not come to see I before you go away . "
<p>
 " I know .
I think I be afraid to talk with you .
but I stand in the darkness before you window , and I whistle . "
<p>
 " do you ? "
she smile at he gladly .
 " that be nice of you .
I can see , though , why you should have be afraid of I-of such a little girl .
It be silly of you . "
<p>
 " I do not know why , " he say .
 " I run away .
I be motivate by a power that be slip out of all the world .
I memory be leave I one by one like a colony of aged swan flying off to some lonely island in the sea to die .
but you become a princess , do you not ? " he question anxiously .
<p>
 " yes , perhaps I do .
I hope I do .
I , too , forget .
tell I , do you really stand there in the dark ? "
<p>
Henry have notice a peculiar thing .
if he look steadily at one of the crouch , faceless being , it disappear .
he amuse she by stare first at one and then at another until all of them be go .
<p>
 " do you really stand there in the dark ? "
<p>
 " I do not know .
perhaps I only think I do . "
he look for Elizabeth , but she , too , have disappear .
in she place there be a red smoulder ember , and the light be dye out of it .
<p>
 " wait , Elizabeth .
tell I where I father be .
I want to see I father . "
<p>
the dye ember answer he .
<p>
 " you father be happily dead .
he be afraid to test even death . "
<p>
 " but merlin , then be merlin ?
if I could only find he . "
<p>
 " merlin ?
you should know of he .
merlin be herd dream in Avalon . "
<p>
the fire go out of the ember with a dry , hard snap .
there be no light anywhere .
for a moment , Henry be conscious of the deep , mellow pulsation of the tone .
<p>
