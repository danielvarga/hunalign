all afternoon the wind sift out of the black welsh glen crying notice that winter be come sliding down over the world from the pole ; and riverward there be the faint moan of new ice
he be a sad day a day of grey unrest of discontent
the gently moving air seem to be celebrate the loss of some gay thing with a soft tender elegy
but in the pasture great work horse nervously stamp he foot and all through the country small brown bird in clique of four or five fly twitter from tree to tree and back again seek and calling in recruit for he southing
a few goat clamber to the tops of high lone rock and long stare upward with he yellow eyes and sniff the heaven
<p>
the afternoon pass slowly procession-like with an end of evening and on the heel of the evening an excited wind rush out rustle in the dry grass and flee whimpering across the field
night draw down like a black cowl and holy winter send he nuncio to wale
<p>
beside the high-road which line the valley run up through a cleft in the hill and so out into the world there stand an ancient farmhouse build of heavy stone and thatch
the morgan who have build he play against time and nearly win
<p>
inside the house a fire be burning on the hearth ; an iron kettle hang over the blaze and a black iron oven hide in the coal which fell about the edge of the flame
the brisk firelight glint on the tip of long-handled pike in rack upon the wall weapon unused in the hundred year since morgan clamour in glendowers' rank and tremble with rage at the flinty lines of iolo goch
<p>
the wide brass binding of a great chest which stand in a corner suck in the light and glow resp1endently
paper there be in the chest and parchment and stiff untanned skin write in english and latin and the old cumric tongue : morgan be born morgan be married morgan become a knight morgan be hang
here lay the history of the house shameful and glorious
but the family be few now and little enough likely to add record to the chest other than the simple chronicle : morgan be born-and die
<p>
there be old robert for instance sitting in he high-backed chair sitting and smile into the fire
he smile be perplexity and a strange passive defiance
he would have say he seek to make that fate which be responsible for he be a little ashamed of himself by smile at he
often he wearily considered he existence ringed around with little defeat which mock he as street child torment a cripple
he be strange to old robert that he who know so much more than he neighbour who have ponder so endlessly should be not even a good farmer
sometimes he imagine he understand too many thing ever to do anything well
<p>
and so old robert sip the burned ale of he own experiment and smile into the fire
he wife would be whisper excuse for he he know and the labourer in the field removed he hat to morgan not to robert
<p>
even he aged mother gwenliana here beside he shiver to the fire as though the very wind sound about the house call in the cold to he be not so judge incompetent
in the cottage there be a little fear of he and a great respect
any day when he sit in the garden holding he necromantic court he might see some farm lad blush and hug he hat across he chest while he listen to gwenliana's magic
for many year now he have be practice the second sight and taking pride in he
and though the family know he prophecy to be whole guess who shrewdness grow less sharp with he year he listen to he with respect and simulated awe and ask of he the location of lose thing
when after one of he mystic recitation the scissors be not discover under the second board of the shed floor he pretend to find them there anyway for have he lose the robe of augury there would have remain only a little wrinkle old woman soon to die
<p>
this play of claque to a simpleton be a harsh tax on the conviction of mother morgan
he outrage he nature for he be one who have apparently come into the world to be a scourge to all foolishness
such matter as have so obviously no connection either with the church or with the price of thing be plainly nonsense
<p>
old robert have love he wife so well and so long that he could think sharp thing about he and the thought could not injure he affection
when he have come home this afternoon rage over the price of a pair of shoe he hadn't want anyway he have considered : "her life be like a book crowded with mighty event
every day he rise to the peak of some tremendous climax which have to do with buttons or a neighbour wedding
i think that when true tragedy come in upon he he will not see he over he range of ant-hill
perhaps this be luck " he think and then wonder now how he would compare the kingbolt own death with the loss of one of the sow red pig "
<p>
mother morgan be too busy with the day himself to be bother with the foolishness of abstraction
some one in the family have to be practical or the thatch would blow away-and what could he expect of a pack of dreamer like robert and gwenliana and he son henry?
he love he husband with a queer mixture of pity and contempt born of he failing and he goodness
<p>
young henry he son he worship though of course he could not trust he to have the least idea of what be to he benefit or conducive to he health
and all of the family love mother morgan and fear he and get in he way
<p>
he have feed them and trim the lamp
breakfast be on the fire
now he search about for something to mend as though he do not mend everything the moment he be tear
in the midst of he search for busyness he pause and glance sharply at young henry
he be the kind of harsh affectionate look which say "i wonder now if he be not in the way of catching cold there on the floor "
and henry squirm wonder what thing he have neglect to do that afternoon
but immediately he catch up a cloth and go to dust and the boy be reassure
<p>
he lay prop on one elbow and stare past the fire into he thought
the long grey afternoon piercing to this mysterious night have call up strong yearning in he the seed of which be plant month before
he be a desire for a thing he could not name
perhaps the same force move he which collected the bird into explore party and make the animal nervously sniff upwind for the scent of winter
<p>
young henry be conscious this night that he have live on for fifteen tedious year without accomplish any single thing of importance
and have he mother known he feeling he would have say "he be grow "
<p>
and he father would have repeated after he "yes the boy be grow "
but neither would have understand what the other mean
<p>
henry if he considered he face draw from he parent almost equally
he cheek bone be high and hard he chin firm he upper lip short and thin like he mother
but there too be the sensual underlip and the fine nose and the eyes which look out on dream ; these be old robert's feature and he be the thick wiry hair coil like black spring against the head
but though there be complete indecision in robert's face there be a great quantity of decision in henry if only he could find something about which to decide
here be three before the fire robert and gwenliana and young henry who eyes look out beyond the wall and saw unbodied thing-look into the night for the ghost
<p>
he be a preternatural night ; a time when he might meet corpse-candle glide along the road or come upon the ghost of a roman legion march at double quick to reach he shelter city of caerleon before the full storm break
and the little misshapen being of the hill would be searching out desert badger hole to cover them from the night
the wind would go crying after them through the field
<p>
in the house he be quiet except for the snap fire-noise and for the swish sound of blow thatch
a log cracked on the hearth and out of the crevice a thin blaze leap up and curl about the black kettle like a flower of flame
now mother flurry to the fireplace
<p>
"robert he will never be pay attention to the fire
he should be poke at he now and again "
<p>
such be he method
he poke a large fire to make he small and when he die he stir the ember violently to restore the flame
<p>
a faint sound of footstep came along the high-road a sound that might have be the wind or those walking thing which can be see
the step grow loud then stopped in front of the door from whence came a timid knock
<p>
"come !
robert call
the door open softly and there light against the black night stand a bent feeble man with eyes like weak flame
he pause on the threshold as though undecided but in a moment advanced into the room ask in a strange creak voice
"will he be knowing he i wonder robert morgan?
will he be knowing he that have be out so long?"
he word be a plea
<p>
robert search the shrink face
<p>
"know you?" he say
"i do not think-wait ! -can he be dafydd? he little farm lad dafydd that go away to sea year past?"
<p>
a look of complete relief came into the face of the wayfarer
he might have be apply some delicate fearful test to robert morgan
now he chuckle
<p>
"it's dafydd sure and rich-and cold "
he finished with a wistfulness like a recur pain
<p>
dafydd be grey-white and toughen like a dry hide
the skin of he face be stiff and thick so that he seem to change expression with slow conscious effort
<p>
"i'm cold robert " he queer dry voice go on
"i can seem ever to get warm again
but anyway i'm rich "-as though he hope these two might balance along with he he call pierre le grand "
<p>
young henry have rise and now he cry :
"where have he be to man
<p>
"where?
why i've be out to the indies that's where i've be ; to goaves and to tortuga the turtle-and to jamaica and the thick woods of hispaniola for the hunting of cattle
i've be all there "
<p>
"you'll be sitting down dafydd " mother morgan interrupted
he spoke as though he have never be away
"i'll about get something warm to drink
will he look how henry gobble he with he eyes dafydd?
like as not he'll be wanting to go to the indies too "
to he the word be a pleasant idiocy
<p>
dafydd keep silence though he appear to be straining back at a desire to talk
mother morgan frighten he as he have when he be a towheaded farm boy
old robert know he embarrassment and mother too seem to sense he for when he have put a steam cup in he hands he left the room
<p>
wrinkle old gwenliana be in he seat before the fire he mind lose in the swim future
he cloud eyes be veiled with tomorrow
behind he vague blue surface seem to crowd the mounting event and circumstance of the world
he be go out of the room-go into pure time and that the future
<p>
old robert watch the door close behind he wife then settle himself with turning as a dog settle
<p>
"now dafydd " he say and peer smile into the fire while henry kneel on the floor gaze with awe at this mortal who hold the very distance in he palm
<p>
"well robert about the green jungle i want to tell and the brown indians that live in he and about he he call pierre le grand
but robert there's something go out of he like a little wink light
i used to lie on the deck of ship at night and think and think how i'd talk arid boast when only i came home again-but it's more like a child i be come home to cry
can he understand that robert?
can he understand that at all?"
he be leaning forward eagerly
<p>
"i'll tell he
he take the tall plate ship he call a galleon and he with only pistol and the long knife he have for cutting trail in the jungle
twenty-four of he there be-only twenty-four and ragged-but robert he do horrid thing with those same long knife
it's no good for a man that be a farm lad to be doing such thing and then thinking about them
there be a fine captain-and he hang he up by he thumb before he kill he
i do know why he do he ; i help and i do know why
some say he be a damned papist but then so be pierre le grand i think
<p>
"some he pushed into the sea with he breast plate shine and shimmer as he go down-grand spanish soldier and bubble coming out of he mouth
he can see deep into the water there "
dafydd cease and look at the floor
<p>
"you see i do want to be hurt he with these thing robert but it's like something alive hide in he chest under he rib and it's biting and scratch to get out of he
i'm rich of the venture sure but most time that do seem enough i'm rich maybe than he own brother sir edward "
<p>
robert be smile with tighten lip
now and then he eyes wander to the boy where he kneel on the hearth
henry be taut with attention gluttonously feed on the word
when robert spoke he avoid dafydd's eyes
<p>
"your soul burden he " he say
"you'd good have a talk with the curate the morning-but about what i do know "
<p>
"no no ; it's not he soul at all " dafydd go on quickly
"that soul leak out of a man the very first thing in the indies and leave he with a dry shrink feeling where he be
it's not he soul at all ; it's the poison that's in he in he blood and in he brain
robert it's shrivel he like an old orange
the crawl thing there and the litt1e flying beast that come to he fire of nights and the great pale flower all poisonous
he do horrible thing to a man
he blood be like cold needle sliding in he vein the moment and the fine fire before he
all this-all-be because of the dank breathing of the jungle
he can sleep in he nor lie in he nor live in he at all but he breathe on he and withers he
<p>
"and the brown indians-why look ! "
he roll back he sleeve and robert in disgust motion he to cover the sick white horror which fester on he arm
<p>
"it be only a little scratch of an arrow-he could hardly see he ; but it'll be killing he before year i guess
there's other thing in he robert
even the humans be poisonous and a song the sailor sing about that "
<p>
now young henry start up excitedly
<p>
"but the indians " he cry ; "those indians and he arrows
tell he about them !
do he fight much?
how do he look?"
<p>
"fight?" say dafydd
"yes he fight always ; fight for a love that's in he
when he do not be fight the man of spain they're at killing amongst himself
lithe as snake he be and quick and quiet and brown as ferret ; the very devil for get out of sight before a man might get a shot at them
<p>
"but they're a brave strong people with the fear in them for only two thing-dog and slavery "
dafydd be immersed in he tale
"why boy can he think what he would be doing to a man that might get himself take in a skirmish?
he stick he full of long jungle thorn from he head to he toe and on the thick end of every thorn a ball of fluff like wool
then the poor captive man stand in a circle of naked savage while he set light to the fluff
and that indian that do not be sing while he burn there like a torch be cursed and call a coward
now can he imagine any white man doing that?
<p>
"but dog he fear because the spaniards hunt them with huge mastiff when they're at slave gathering for the mine ; and slavery be horrible to them
to go chain body to body into the wet earth year on the crown of year until he die of the damp ague-rather would he be sing under the burning thorn and dye in a flame "
<p>
he pause and stretch he thin hands into the fireplace until he be nearly touching the blaze
the light which have come into he eyes as he talk die out again
<p>
"oh i'm tire robert-so very tire " he sigh "but there's one thing i want to tell he before i sleep
maybe the telling will ease he and maybe i can speak he out and then forget about he for the one night
i musth go back to the damned place
i can never stay away from the jungle any more because he hot breath be on he
here where i be born i shiver and freeze
a month would find he dead
this valley where i play and grow and worked have cast he out for a foul hot thing
he clean himself of he with the cold
<p>
"now will he be give he a place to sleep with thick cover to keep he poor blood moving ; and in the morning i'll be off again "
he stopped and he face flex with pain
"i used to love the winter so "
<p>
old robert help he from the room with a hand under he arm then came and sit again by the fire
he look at the boy who lay unmoving on the floor
<p>
"what be he thinking about now son?" he ask very softly after a time
and henry draw he gaze back from the land beyond the blaze
<p>
"i'm thinking i'll be wanting to go soon father "
<p>
"i know henry
the whole of this long year i've see he grow in he like a strong tree or guinea or jamaica
he come of be fifteen and strong with the passion for new thing on he
once i saw the valley grow small and small too until finally he smother he a little i think
but be he afraid of the knife son and the poison and the indians?
do not these thing put fear on you?"
<p>
"no-o-o " henry say slowly
<p>
"of course not-and how could they?
the word have no meaning to he at all
but the sadness of dafydd and the hurt of he and he poor sick body be he afraid of those?
do he want to go about the world weigh down with such a heart?"
<p>
young henry considered long
<p>
"i would not be like that " he say at last
"i would be coming back very often for he blood sake "
<p>
he father go on smile valiantly
<p>
"when will he be off henry?
he will be lonely here without he "
<p>
"why i'll go now as soon as i may " say henry ; and he seem that he be the old and robert a little boy
<p>
"henry will he do two thing for he before he go?
will he be thinking tonight of the long sleeplessness i'll have because of he and of how lose he days will be
and will he remember the hours he mother will fret about he underclothing and the state of he religion
that's the first thing henry ; but second will he go up to old merlin on the crag-top tomorrow and tell he of he going and listen to he words?
he be wise than he or i may ever be
there be a kind of magic he practice which may be a help to he
will he do these two thing son?"
<p>
henry have become very sad
<p>
"i would like to stay he father but he know
"yes boy "
robert nod
"it be he sorrow that i do know
i can be angry nor forbid he going because i understand
i wish i might prevent he and whip he thinking that i help he
but go to bed henry and think and think when the light be out and the dark in around he "
<p>
old robert sit dream in he chair after the boy have go
<p>
"why do man like he want sons?" he wonder
"it musth be because he hope in he poor beat soul that these new man who be he blood will do the thing he be not strong enough nor wise enough nor brave enough to do
he be rather like another chance with life ; like a new bag of coin at a table of luck after he fortune be go
perhaps the boy be doing what i might have done have i be brave enough year past
yes the valley have smother he i think and i be glad this boy of mine find he in he power to vault the mountain and stride about the world
but he will be-so very lonely here without he "
<p>
ii
old robert came in from he rose garden late the next morning and stand in the room where he wife be sweeping
he eyed the good soil on he hands with disapproval
<p>
"he'll be wanting to go now mother " robert say nervously
<p>
"who will be wanting to go and where?"
he be brusque and busy with he sweeping ; the quick inquisitive broom hound dust from the corner and floor crack and drive he in little puff to the open
<p>
"why henry
he'll be wanting to go to the indies now "
<p>
he stopped he work to stare at he
"the indies !
but robert !
oh nonsense ! " he finished and the broom swing more rapidly in he hands
<p>
"i've see he for long and long grow in he " robert go on
"then dafydd came with he tales
henry tell he last night that he musth go "
<p>
"he's only a little boy " mother morgan snap
"he can be going to the indies "
<p>
"when dafydd set out a little time ago there be a longing in the child eyes that will never be satisfy at all not even if he do go to the indies
have he notice mother how he eyes look away beyond the mountain at something he wants?"
<p>
"but he may not go !
he may not ! "
<p>
"ah there be no use in he mother
a great gulf lie between he son and he but none at all between he and he son
if i do not know the lean hunger of he so well i might forbid he venture and he would run away with anger in he heart for he can understand the hunger that's in he for he stay
he would come to the same thing anyway "
robert gather conviction
<p>
"there's a cruel difference between he son and he
i've see he in the year of he grow
for whereas he run about stick he finger into pot after pot of cold porridge grandly confident that each one will prove the pottage of he dream i may not open any kettle for i believe all porridge to be cold
and so-i imagine great dish of purple porridge drench with dragon milk sugared with a sweetness only to be envision
he test he dream mother and i-god help he ! -am afraid to "
<p>
he be becoming impatient with he talk
<p>
"robert " he cry almost angrily "in any time where there's bode on he or need or sorrow he hide in word
here be a duty to he !
this boy be too young
there be horrible place across the sea and the winter come in at he
he would be sure to find he death in a cough that came to he from the winter
he know how the dampness on he foot set he sick
he musth not leave this farm not even to london i say-if these eyes he talk about starve in he head
<p>
"how could he possibly know what kind of people he would be taking up with and he telling he nonsense and wickedness
i know the evil that's in the world
do the curate mention he nearly every sabbath and snare he call them do he see?
and so he be too
and here he stand content to talk foolishness about purple porridge when he should be doing something or other
he musth forbid he "
<p>
but robert answer he impatiently
<p>
"to he he be only a little boy who musth be make to say he prayer of nights and to wear a coat into the field he have not feel the polished steel of he as i have
yes to he that quick hard set of he chin be only the passing stubbornness of a headstrong child
but i do know ; and i say to he without pleasure that this son of he will be a great man because-well-because he be not very intelligent
he can see only one desire at a time
i say he test he dream ; he will murder every dream with the implacable arrows of he will
this boy will win to every goal of he aim ; for he can realize no think no reason but he own
and i be sorry for he coming greatness because of a thing merlin once spoke of
he musth look at the granite jaws of he mother and the trick he have of making he cheek muscle stand out with clench them "
<p>
"he musth not go " he say firmly and pinch he lip tightly together
<p>
"you see mother " robert go on "you be something like henry himself for he never admit the existence of any idea save he own
but i will not forbid he going because i musth not have he steal out into the lonely dark with bread and cheese under he coat and a hurt feeling of injustice in he heart
i permit he to go
more i help he to go if he wish he
and then if i have misjudge he son he will come sneaking back with the fearful hope that no one may mention he cowardice "
<p>
mother morgan say "nonsense ! " and go back to he work
he would dissolve this thing by disbelieve he
oh the thousand thing he chain to limbo with he incredulity !
for many year he have beat robert's wild thought with a heavy phalanx of common sense ; he troop simply charge in and overwhelm he
always he retire wearily and sit smile for a time
he be sure to come back to sanity in this case as in other
<p>
robert be working the soil about the root of a rose bush with he strong brown hands
he finger lift the black loam and then pat he gently back into place
now and again he stroke the grey trunk of the bush with the touch of great love
he be as though he smooth the cover over one about to sleep and touched he arm to be reassure of he safety
<p>
the day be light for winter have inched back a bit and return he hostage to the world-a small cold sun
young henry came and stand near an elm by the wall a tree draggle and leafless and gaunt with nurse the wind
<p>
"you have be thinking as i ask you?"
robert spoke quietly
<p>
henry start
he do not know that the man kneel as though in adoration of the earth have notice he ; and yet he have come here to be notice
<p>
"yes father " he say
"how could i help be thinking?"
<p>
"and have he bound he here?
will he be staying?"
<p>
"no father i may not stay "
he have be make sad with he father sadness
he feel mean and shoddy to be the cause of he but the hunger to be going still gnaw in he heart
<p>
"will he be walking up to speak with merlin on the crag-top then?"
robert plead
"will he listen to he word with great care?"
<p>
"i shall go now "
<p>
"but henry the day be half done with and the track be long
be wait until the morrow "
<p>
"i musth be away the morrow father "
<p>
old robert's hands slip away slowly to the ground and lay half-open on the black soil at the root of the rose bush
<p>
1 1 2 iii
young henry turn soon from the road to climb up a broad trail which soar to crag-top and then over the wild mountain
he winding could be see from below until he disappear into the great deft
and on the topmost point of the trail dwell merlin ; merlin who the farm boy might have jeer at and stoned on he infrequent journey down the path have he believe he harmless
but merlin be one who collected about himself a swarm of little legend
he be establish that the tylwyth teg obey he and carry he message through the air on soundless wing
child whisper of he acquaintance with certain mottle weasel which might carry on he vengeance have he need of such
then too he keep a red-eared dog
these be terrific thing and merlin one not to be trifle with by child who do not know all the sign for protect himself
<p>
once merlin have be a fine poet the old people say and might have be a great
he would softly sing "the sorrow of plaith" or "the spear song " to prove he
several time he have take the chief prise of the eisteddfod and would have be choose first bard if an aspirant of the house of rhys have not enter against he
then without known cause and merlin a young man too he have shut up he song in the stone house on crag top and keep he a strict prisoner there while he grow old and old-and those who have sing he song forget them or die
<p>
the crag-top house be round like a low grey tower with window let sight on the valley and on the mountain
some say that he be build by a beleaguer giant century ago to keep he virgin hide while he be in that state ; and other that kingbolt harold have flee there after hastings to live out he life ever watch and peer with he one eye down the valley and over the mountain for the coming of normans
<p>
merlin be old now ; he hair and long straight beard be white and soft as spring cloud
there be much about he of an ancient druid priest with clear far-seeing eyes which watch the star
<p>
the pathway narrow on young henry as he climb
<p>
he inward side be a stone wall cutting into the heaven knife-like and the misshapen vague image along the way make he seem the rock temple of some old crude god who worshipers be ape
<p>
there have be grass at first and bush and a few brave twist tree ; but upward all living thing die of the rock loneliness
far below the farmhouse huddle like feed bug and the valley shrink and draw into himself
<p>
now a mountain closed in on the other side of the trail leave only a broad chasm to the sky
a fierce steady wind pour out of the blue heaven and shrill toward the valley
upward the strew rock be large and more black and dreadful-crouch guardian thing of the path
<p>
henry climb tirelessly on
what could old merlin have to tell he or perhaps to give him?
a lotion to make he skin tough and proof against arrows?
some charm?
word to protect he from the devil many little servants?
but merlin be to talk and he to listen ; and what merlin say might cure young henry of he yearning might keep he here in cambria for always
that could not be for there be outland force nameless foreign ghost calling to he and beckon from across the mysterious sea
<p>
there be no desire in he for a state or a condition no picture in he mind of the thing to be when he have follow he longing ; but only a burning and a will overpowering to journey outward and outward after the earliest rise star
<p>
the path break on a top of solid stone semispherical like the crown of a hat ; and on the peak of he rise be the low round house of merlin all fitted of irregular rough rock and a conical roof on he like a candle snuffer
<p>
the old man meet he at the door before he could knock
<p>
"i'm young henry morgan sir and i'm going outward from here to the indies "
<p>
"indeed and be you?
will he come in and talk to he about it?"
the voice be clear and low and lovely as a young wind croon in a spring-time orchard
there be the music of sing in he the quiet sing of a man working with tool ; and underneath half-hear or completely imagine there ring the seeming of harp string lightly touched and left to thrill
<p>
the single room be thick carpet in black and on the wall be hang harp and spear-head harp and spear-head all the way around ; small welsh harp and the great bronze leaf spear of the britons and these against the unfinished stone
below these be the all-seeing window wherefrom he might look out on three valley and a mighty family of mountain ; and lower still a single bench circle around the room against the wall
there be a table in the center loaded with tatter book and beside he a copper brazier set on a greek tripod of black iron
<p>
the great hound nuzzle henry as he enter so that he draw away in fright for be there anything under the blue cup so deadly as the merest notice of a red-eared dog?
<p>
"you be going to the indies
sit here boy
see !
he can watch he home valley now so that he go not flying off avalon "
the harp catch up he tone and hem an answer faint resonance
<p>
"my father say i be to come here and tell he of he going and listen to he speech
he father think he speech may keep he here "
<p>
"going to the indies " merlin repeated
"will he be seeing elizabeth before he go and making grand promise to flutter the heart of he and strangle the breath in he after you're go from thinking of the thing he will bring back to her?"
<p>
henry blush deeply
"who tell he i think at all of the little rat?" he cry
"who be he say at all that i care for her?"
<p>
"oh the wind whisper something " say merlin ; "and then there be some word of he in he talk cheek and he bluster just now
i think he should be speaking to elizabeth not to he
he father should have known better?'
he voice die away
when he spoke again he be with sad earnestness
<p>
"must he leave he father boy-and he so sure alone in the valley of man who be not like him?
yes i think that he musth go
the plan of boy be serious thing and unchangeable
but what can i say to he to keep he here young henry?
he father scend he a task difficult to fulfill
<p>
"i go out on a tall spanish ship a thousand year ago he musth be more than that or perhaps i do not go at all and only dream he
he came at last on these green indies and he be lovely but unchanging
he cycle be a green monotony
if he go there he musth give up the year ; musth lose the pang of utter dread in the deep winter with he bode that the world have flee solar fealty to go careen into lonely space so that spring may never come again
and he musth lose that wild excited quicken when the sun turn back the joy of he flood over he like the surge of a warm wave and choke he with pleasure and relief
no change there ; none at all
past and future mingle in an odious eternal now "
<p>
"but there be no change here " young henry interpose
"year on top of year be the crop put in and new calve lick by he mother ; year on top of year be a pig slaughter and the ham smoke
spring come surely but nothing happen "
<p>
"true enough blind boy ; and i see that he be talk of different thing "
merlin look out of he window to the mountain and the valley and a great love for the land shine in he eyes ; but when he turn back to the boy there be the look of pain in he face
he voice take on the cadence of a song
<p>
"i will plead with he for this dear cambria where time be pile mountain high and crumble ancient days about he base " he cry passionately
"have he lose he love of wild cambria that he would leave he when the blood of he thousand ancestor have go soak into the soil to keep he cambria for always?
have he forget that he be of the trojan race?
ah but he wander too do he when pergamus fell in?"
<p>
henry say "i have lose no love sir but he dream be over the sea that i do not know
i know cambria "
<p>
"but boy here great arthur live who drive he standard into rome and sail away undying to dear avalon
and avalon himself lie off he coast somewhere over the sink city ; there he floats endlessly
and have he not hear them henry the ghost of all those good brave quarrelsome inefficient man llaw giffes and belerius and arthur and cadwallo and brute?
he walk like cloud through the land and guard he from the high place
there be no ghost in the indies and no tylwyth teg
<p>
"in these wild black hill there be a million mystery
have he found out the chair of arthur or the meaning of the circle stones?
have he hear the voice that cry out triumph in the night and the hunter of soul with he scream horn and he pack of blue hound who rush into the village on the storm?"
<p>
"i have hear them " say henry shudder
he glance shyly at the dog asleep on the floor and spoke in a lower tone
"the curate say these thing be lie
he say the red book be a book for little child before the fire and a shame for man and big boy to be believe in
he tell he at church school these be lie tales and unchristian
arthur be an unimportant chieftain he say and merlin who name he bear a figment of the mad brain of jeffery of monmouth
he spoke ill of the tylwyth teg and of the corpse-candle and of such as he honour he dog here "
<p>
"oh the fool ! " cry merlin in disgust
"the fool breaking these thing !
and he offer instead a storey to the world by twelve collaborator with rather slovenly conviction in some matter
why musth he go boy?
do he not see that the enemy of cambria fight no more with the sword but with little pointed tongues?"
the harp sing he question then slowly cease he throb and there be silence in the round house
<p>
henry studied the floor with drawn brow
at last he say "there be so much bother about he
i can seem to talk of this thing merlin
i will come back
surely i will when this burning for new thing be quench
but do he see that i musth go for he seem that i be cut in half and only one part of he here
the other piece be over the sea calling and calling he to come and be whole
i love cambria and i will come back when i be whole again "
<p>
merlin search the boy face closely
sadly he look up at he harp
"i think i understand " he say softly
"you be a little boy
he want the moon to drink from as golden cup ; and so he be very likely that he will become a great man-if only he remain a little child
all the world great have be little boy who want the moon running and climbing he sometimes catch a firefly
but if one grow to a man mind that mind musth see that he can have the moon and would not want he if he could -and so he catch no firefly
<p>
"but do he never want the moon?" ask henry in a voice hush with the room quiet
<p>
"i want he
above all desire i want he
i reach for he and then-then i grow to be a man and a failure
but there be this gift for the failure ; folk know he have fail and he be sorry and kindly and gentle
he have the whole world with he ; a bridge of contact with he own people ; the cloth of mediocrity
but he who shield a firefly in he hands catch in reach for the moon be doubly alone ; he only can realize he true failure can realize he meanness and fear and evasion
<p>
"you will come to he greatness and he may be in time he will be alone in he greatness and no friend anywhere ; only those who hold he in respect or fear or awe
i be sorry for he boy with the straight clear eyes which look upward longingly
i be sorry for he and-mother heaven ! how i envy he "
<p>
dusk be steal into the mountain crease filling them with purple mist
the sun cut himself on a sharp hill and bleed into the valley
long shadow of the peak creep out into the field like stalk grey cat
when merlin spoke he be with a little laugh
<p>
"do not think deeply of he word " he say "for i himself be not at all sure of them
dream he may know by a quality he call inconsistency-but how could he classify the lightning?"
now the night be close in quickly and henry jump to he foot
<p>
"oh but i musth be going !
the dark be in ! "
<p>
"yes he musth go but do not think closely of he word
i may have be trying to impress he with these word
old man need a certain silent flattery when he have come to distrust that which be speak
only remember that merlin talk with he
and if he come on the welsh folk anywhere sing he song that be make so long ago tell them that he know he ; tell them that i be a glorious creature with blue wing
i do want to be forget henry
that be great horror to an old man than death-to be forget "
<p>
henry say "i musth be going now ; it's really dark
and thank he sir for telling he these thing but he see i musth be sailing outward to the indies "
<p>
merlin laugh softly
"of course he musth henry
and catch a big firefly will he
good-by child "
<p>
henry look back once as the black silhouette of the house sink behind the crag shoulder but no light have flash behind the window
old merlin sit there pleading with he harp and he echoed he jeeringly
<p>
the boy quicken he step down the path
all below be a black lake ; and the farm lights star reflectance in he deep
the wind have die leave a thick silence on the hill
everywhere the sad soundless ghost flit about he haunting
henry walk carefully he eyes on the path which glimmer pale blue before he
<p>
1 1 3 iv
on the path there be the dark henry mind go back to the first speech of merlin
should he see elizabeth before he go sailing away?
he do not like he ; sometimes he think he have discover hatred for he and this he nurse and warm only to feel he grow to a desire to see he
<p>
he be a thing of mystery
all girl and woman hoard something he never spoke of
he mother have terrific secret about biscuit and cry sometimes for no known reason
another life go on inside of woman-some woman-run parallel to he outward live and yet never cross them
<p>
a year before ; elizabeth have be a pretty child who whisper to the other girl and giggle and pull hair when he be about ; and then suddenly he have change
he be nothing henry could see exactly but rather he feel that a deep quiet understanding have be give he
he frighten he this wisdom which have come all at once to elizabeth
<p>
then there be he body-different somehow from he and capable he be whisper of strange pleasure and alchemy
even this flowering body he keep a secret thing
a time ago he have go together to swim in the river and he have be unconscious of he ; but now he cover himself carefully from he and appear strike with the think that he might see
he new character frighten and embarrass henry
<p>
sometimes he dream of he and wake in agony lest he should ever know he dream
and sometimes he be a strange shadowy composite of elizabeth and he mother that came to he in the night
after such a dream the day bring loathing of himself and he
he considered himself an unnatural monster and he a kind of succubus incarnate
and he could tell no one of these thing
the people would shun he
<p>
he think perhaps he would like to see he before he left
there be a strange power in he this year a drawing yet repel power which sway he desire like a windblown reed
other boy might have go to he in the night and kiss he after he have boast a little of he going ; but then the other boy do not dream as he do nor do he think of he as he sometimes do as a loathsome be
there be surely something monstrous about he for he could not distinguish between desire and disgust
and then he could embarrass he so easily
<p>
no certainly he would not go to he
where have merlin-where have any one catch the idea that he care a farthing for he the daughter of a poor tenant?
not worth bother about !
<p>
footstep be coming down the path behind he loud clash in the quiet night and soon a quick thin figure came up with he
<p>
"might he be william?"
henry ask politely while the road-mender stopped in the path and shift he pick from one shoulder to the other
<p>
"it's william right enough
and what be he doing on the path and the dark come?"
<p>
"i've be to see merlin and to hear he talk "
<p>
"pest on he !
that's all he ever do now
once he make song-good sweet song as i could repeat to he if i'd a mind to-but now he roost up on that crag-top like an old molt eagle
once when i be going past i spoke to he about he too as i can prove by he
i'm not a man to be holding he tongue when i've be thinking
<p>
"why be he making no more songs?'
i say to he in a tone like that
'why be he making no more songs?'
'i have grown to be a man ' he answer 'and there be no song in a man
only child make song-child and idiot '
pest on he !
it's an idiot himself be the think be on he
but what do he say to he the old whitebeard?"
<p>
"why he see i'm going to the indies and
"the indies and be you?
ah well-i be at london once
and all the people at london be thieve dirty thieve
there be a man with a board and little flat stick on he
'try he skill friend?' he say
'what stick have a black mark on the underside of it?'
'that one ' say i ; and so he be
but the next time-ah well he be a thief too ; all of them thieve
<p>
"people there be at london and he do nothing but drive about and about in carriage up one street and down another bowing to each other while good man sweat out he live in the field and the mine to keep them bowing there
what chance have i or he say with all the fine soft place take up by robbers?
and can he tell he the thieve price of an egg at london?"
<p>
"i musth take this road now " say henry
"i musth go home "
<p>
"indies "
the road-mender sigh with longing
then he spit in the trail
"ah well stake it's all thieve there too "
<p>
the night be very black when henry came at last to the poor hut where elizabeth live
there be a fire in the middle of the floor he know and the smoke drift up and try to get out at a small hole in the thatch
the house have no flooring but only rush strew on the pack ground and when the family sleep he wrapped himself in sheepskin and lay in a circle with he foot to the fire
<p>
the window be not glaze nor curtain
henry could see old black twym and he thin nervous wife moving about inside
he watch for elizabeth to pass the window and when at last he do he whistle a shrill bird-call
the girl stopped and look out but henry be quiet in the dark
then elizabeth open the door and stand frame against the inside light
the fire be behind he
henry could see the black outline of he figure through he diving
he saw the fine curve of he leg and the swell of he hip
a wild shame fill he for he and for himself
without think and without reason he run away into the dark gasp and almost sob under he breath
<p>
1 1 4 v
old robert look up hopefully when the boy came into the room and then the hope die away and he turn quickly to the fire
but mother morgan jump from he seat and go angrily to henry
<p>
"what be this foolishness?
he going to the indies ! " he demand
<p>
"but mother i musth go ; truly i musth-and father understand
can he hear how the indies be calling to me?"
<p>
"that i can !
it's wicked nonsense be in he
a little child he be and not to be trust from home at all
besides he own father be going to tell he he may not be "
<p>
the strong jaw of the boy set like a rock and the muscle stand out in he cheek
suddenly there came a flash of anger into he eyes
<p>
"then mother if he will not understand i tell he that i be going the morrow-in spite of all of he "
<p>
hurt pride chase incredulity from he face and that too pass leave only pain
he shrink from the bewilder hurt
and henry when he saw what he word have done go quickly to he
<p>
"i'm sorry mother-so very sorry ; but why can he not let he go as he father can?
i do want to hurt he but i musth go
will he see that?"
he put he arm about he but he would not look at he
he eyes stare blankly straight in front of he
<p>
he be so sure that he view be right
throughout he life he have insult and browbeat and scold he family and he have known he little tyranny to be the outcrop of he love for them
but now that one of them and he the child have used the tone he spoke with every hour he make a grim hurt that might never be quite heal again
<p>
"you spoke with merlin?
what do he say to you? ask robert from the hearth
<p>
henry mind flash quickly to elizabeth
"he talk of thing that be not in he belief " he say
<p>
"well-he be only a chance " murmur robert
"you've hurt he mother badly boy " he go on
"i've never see he so-so quiet "
then robert straighten himself and he voice become firm
<p>
"i have five pound for he son
it's little enough ; i suppose i might give he a small matter more but not enough to help much
and here be a letter recommend he to he brother sir edward
he go out before the kingbolt be murder and for some reason-perhaps because he be quiet-old cromwell have let he stay
if he be there when he come to jamaica he may present this letter ; but it's a cold strange man who take great pride in he rich acquaintance and might be a little annoy with a poor relative
and so i do not know that good will come of this letter
he would dislike he unless he be able to see nothing funny in a man who look like he only stride about with a silver sword and plume on he head
i laugh once and he have not be a near brother to he since
but keep the letter he may help he with other people if not with he uncle "
<p>
he look at he wife sitting huddle in the shadow
"will he not have supper mother?"
<p>
he make no sign that he hear he and robert himself pour the pot and bring the food to the table
<p>
he be a cruel thing to lose a son for who he have live continuously
somehow he have imagine he always beside he-a little boy and always beside he
he try to think of the coming days and henry not there but the think be shatter on the bleak wall of a lean imagination
he attempt to consider he ungrateful so to run away from he ; he recall the harsh blow he have deal he-but always the mind snap back
henry be he little boy and naturally he could not be mean nor treacherous
in some way when all this talk and pain have drift into the thin air he would be yet beside he deliciously underfoot
<p>
he mind which have be always a scalpel of reality he imagination which deal purely with the present outsides of thing go fondle back to the baby who have crawl and stumble and learned to talk
he forget that he be going away at all so deeply be he lave in a reverie of the silver past
<p>
he be be baptize in a long white diving
all the water of baptism collected in one big drop and roll down he blobby nose and he in he passion for tidiness wipe he off with a handkerchief and then wonder if he should be baptize again
the young curate be perspire and choke over he word
he be lately come to the parish and be only a local boy anyway
he be really too young he think to be trust with an affair of this importance
perhaps he would take
he might get the word in the wrong order or something
and then have make a mess of he waistcoat again
he never could get the right button in the right hole to save he
he make he look all rack to one side
he musth go and tell robert about he waistcoat before people in the church notice he
small thing like that be sure to cause talk
but could he trust this foolish young curate not to let the baby fall while he went?
<p>
supper be over and aged gwenliana rose from the table to struggle back to he seat before the fire
quietly he be slip back into he friendly future
<p>
"what time will he be start the morning?" ask robert
<p>
"why about seven i think father "
henry try to sound casual
<p>
the ancient woman pause in he journey and look sharply at he
<p>
"now where be henry going?" he ask
<p>
"why do he know?
henry be going away from he in the morning
he be going to the indies "
<p>
"and not coming back again?" he question anxiously
<p>
"not for a time anyway
it's a great distance "
<p>
"why but-i musth lay the future before he then that's what i musth do before he like the white page of an open book " he exclaim in please excitement
"i musth tell he of the future and the thing in he
let he look at he boy "
<p>
henry go to he and sit at he foot while he talk
there be truly a spell in the ancient cumric tongue
he be a speech make for prophecy
<p>
"of course " gwenliana say "if i have only known of this today i should have get the shoulder bone of a new-kill sheep
it's a means of great antiquity and good think of than just snap-prophecy
and since i have grown old and rusty and lame i can go about any more to meet the spirit that wander the high-road
he can do as well if there be not the means in he to walk amongst the stroll dead and listen to he thought
but i shall give he a thorough life grandson and as fine a future as i ever ponder on "
<p>
he lean back in he chair and closed he eyes but if one have look closely he might have see he glint below the lid where he peer out at the set face of the boy
a long time he sit entrance and he seem that he old brain comb out the tangle of the past to make a straight tellable future
at length he spoke in the low hoarse chant voice that be reserved for dread thing
<p>
"this be the tale out of abred when earth and water battle
and from the impact of he clash be born a little struggle life to squirm upward through the circle toward gwynfyd the sheen purity
in that first blunder flesh be write the world history and the world journey through the void
<p>
"and thou-often have annwn set he fanged maw to entrap the little pinch of life thou carryest about but thou hast make thy path to go around he snare
a thousand century hast thou live since earth and sea struggle in thy generation and a thousand eon shalt thou carry about the little pinch of life that be give thee so only thou shelterest he from annwn the chaos "
<p>
always he begin he prophecy thus
he be a thing teach he by a wandering bard to who he have come from bard to bard back and back to the white druid
gwenliana pause to let he word find footing in the boy brain
he continue :
"this be the tale of thy present wandering
thou shalt become a great shine for the divine teaching the thing of god "
he secret eyes saw the boy face fall in disappointment and he cry :
"but wait a moment !
i go too far ahead
there shall be fight and shed of blood and the sword shall be thy first bride "
henry face light up with pleasure
"the whisper of thy name shall be a foregather command to the warrior of the world
thou shalt sack the city of the infidel and spoil he of he plunderings
the terror will precede thee like a scream eagle over the shield of man "
he know now that he forecast be a success but he hasten on to great glory
<p>
"the government of island and continent shall be thine and thou shalt bring justice and peace to them
and at last when thou art gird with honour and repute thou shalt marry a white maiden of mighty rank-a girl of good family and wealthy " he finished
he eyes open and he glance about for he approbation
<p>
"i could have done good with a sheep shoulder " he say plaintively "or if i could be walking about on the high-road now and then ; but age rob he of he little pleasure and leave he with only a cold quiet wait "
<p>
"ah well mother he be a good prophecy " say old robert ; "as good as i ever hear he make
he be just coming to the peak of he occult strength i think
and he have take away he dread and reassure he about henry going
now i be only proud of what he boy be to be
only i wish he do have to kill people "
<p>
"well then-if he think he be really good ! " say gwenliana happily
"it do seem to he that the air be propitious and he eyes clear tonight
still i should have like a sheep shoulder "
he closed he eyes contentedly and go to doze
<p>
1 1 5 vi
all night old robert toss nervously in he bed and he wife lay motionless beside he
at last when the darkness be change to silver grey in the window he rose quietly
<p>
"what?
have he not be sleep mother?
and where be he going?"
<p>
"i be going to henry now
i musth talk with he
perhaps he will listen to he "
only a moment he be go and then he return and lay he head on robert's arm
<p>
"henry be go " he say and he whole body stiffen a little
<p>
"gone?
but how could he do that?
here be he first cowardice mother
he be afraid to say good-by to he
but i be not sorry for he fear because he hold the sureness of he sorrow
he could not bear to hear the thing of he feeling in word
<p>
"why mother ! "
he be startle at he silence and he coldness
"he will come back to he mother in a little ; perhaps when the spring grass be lift out
surely he will come back to he
i swear he
can he believe it?
he be go only for a week-a few days
oh believe he !
<p>
"the year be go from he surely dear and now he be as he be-do he remember?-only closer-closer of all the thing that have be
he be rich with all the little picture of the past and the thing he play with
he can never go from he while life be here "
<p>
he do not weep nor move nor even seem to breathe
"oh he wife-elizabeth say that he will believe in he coming very soon-soon-before he have miss he " he cry wildly
"do not lie there silently and lose
he will be here when the spring come in
he musth believe he dear-he dear "
very softly he stroke the still cheek beside he with he great tender finger
<p>
1 1 6 vii
he have creep from the house in the false dawn and start briskly walking on the road to cardiff
there be a freeze frighten thing in he heart and a wonder whether he want to go at all
to he mind the fear have argue that if he wait to say good-by he would not be able to leave the stone house not even for the indies
<p>
the sky be grey as he go by pasture where he have toss and play and by the quarry where be the cave in which he and he friend act the delightful game of "robbers " with henry always the wild wag twym shine catti by acclamation
<p>
the mountain stand sharply before he like cardboard thing and along he rim a silver fringe
a little wind of dawn blow down the slope fresh and sweet smell bearing the rich odour of moisten earth and leave
horse whinny shrilly at he as he pass then came close and gently touched he with he soft nose ; and covey of bird feed on belated night crawler in the half dark fly up at he approach with startle protest
<p>
by sun-up there be new mile behind he
as the yellow ball slide from behind the peak coloring all the tatter cloud of the mountain henry draw a thick curtain down against the past
the pain and loneliness that have walk with he in the dark be pushed back and left behind he
cardiff be ahead
he be coming to new country which he have never see before and below the morning horizon faint and glorious seem to glow the green crown of the indies
<p>
he pass through village who name be unknown to he ; friendly little cluster of rude hut and the people stare at he as at a stranger
he be a joyous thing to young henry
always he have stare at other who be stranger dream he destination and the delicious mystery that send them forth
the name of stranger make them grand being with mighty purpose
and now he be a stranger to be think about and stare at with a certain reverence
he want to shout "i'm on he way to the indies " to widen he dull eyes for them and raise he respect
silly spineless creature he think them with no dream and no will to leave he sodden dumpy hut
<p>
the land change
he be coming out of the mountain to a broad unbounded country of little roll and flat lands
he saw large burrow like the hole of tremendous gopher and dirty black man coming out of them with sack of coal on he back
the miner empty he sack in a pile on the ground and then walk back into the burrow
he notice that he stoop when he walk as though the heavy bags be still bearing them down
<p>
midday came and a long clear afternoon and still he trudge on
there be a new odour in the air the sweet compelling breath of the sea
he want to break into a run toward he like a thirsty horse
in the late afternoon an army of black cloud draw over the sky
a wind rush out with snow in he breath and the grass bow before he
<p>
still he go on into the gathering storm until he be armed with sleet which prick he face viciously and until the cold go piercing through he jacket
there be occasional house to either side of the road but henry would seek shelter and food at none of them
he do not know the customs of this place nor the price of thing and he five pound musth be intact when he came at last to cardiff
<p>
at length when he hands be blue and he face raw with the wild sleet he crawl into a lonely stone barn fill with the summer hay
he be warm there and quiet after the scream of the wind in he ear
the hay be sweet with the honey dry in he stem
henry burrow into the soft bed and sleep
<p>
he be dark night when he awaken
half-dream he remember where he be and at once the thought which he have shut from he the day before throng back with clamour strident voice
<p>
"you be a fool " say one
"remember the big room and the pike and the bright fire !
where be he now?
oh he will not see them any more
he be go out like thing of dream and he do not even know where dream go
he be a fool ! "
<p>
"no no ; listen to he !
think of he !
why do he not wait for elizabeth?
be he afraid?
yes he be afraid
this boy be a coward brother
he be afraid of a small girl with yellow hair-a tenant daughter "
<p>
a sad slow voice break in
"think of he mother henry
he be sitting straight and still when he last saw he
and he do not go to he
he only look from the doorway as he go
perhaps he have die in he chair with the look of hurt in he eyes
how can he tell?
and robert he own father-will he think of he now-lonely and sad and lose
it's he doing henry because he want to go to the indies he do not think of any one else "
<p>
"and what do he know of the future?" ask a tiny fearful voice
"it will be cold and perhaps he will freeze
or some stranger may kill he for he money little as he be
such thing have happen
always there have be some one to look after he and to see that he be comfortable
oh he will starve ! he will freeze ! he will die !
i be sure of he ! "
<p>
then the noise of the barn edge in amongst he tormentor
the storm be past but a breeze sigh around corner with infinite ghostly sadness
now and again he voiced a little wail of sorrow
there be a creak in the hay as though every straw squirm and try to move stealthily
bat flit about in the dark gnash he tiny tooth and the mouse be scream horribly
bat and mouse seem to be glaring at he from obscurity with small mean eyes
<p>
he have be alone before but never so thoroughly alone amongst new thing in a place he do not know
the terror be grow and swelling in he breast
time have become an idle worm which crawl ahead the merest trifle stopped and waggle he blind head and crawl again
he seem that hours pass over he like slow sailing cloud while he lay shiver with fright
at last an owl fly in and circle above he screech maniacally
<p>
the boy overstrung nerves snap and he run whimpering from the barn and down the road toward cardiff
<p>
1 2 chapter ii
for more than a century britain have watch with impatience while spain and portugal with the permission of the pope divided the new world and patrol he property to keep out interloper
he be a bitter thing to england there imprison by the sea
but finally drake have burst the barrier and sail the forbid ocean in he little golden hind
the great red ship of spain considered drake only a tiny sting fly an annoy thing to be kill for he buzz ; but when the fly have gut he floating castle burned a town or two and even set a traprock for the sacred treasure train across the isthmus he be forced to alter he conception
the fly be a hornet a scorpion a viper a dragon
he name he el draque and a fear of the english grow up in the new world
<p>
when the armada fell before the english and the angry sea spain be terrify at this new force which emanate from such a very little island
he be sad to think of these bright carve ship lie on the bottom or tear to fragment on the irish coast
<p>
and britain thrust he hand into the caribbean ; a few island came under he power barbados
now the product of the home island could be sell in colony
he add prestige to a little country to have colony provided he be strongly populate ; and england begin to populate he new possession
<p>
young son spendthrift ruin gentleman sail out for the indies
he be a fine way to be rid of a dangerous man
the kingbolt have only to grant he land in the indies and then express the desire that he live on he property and cultivate the rich soil there for the good of the english crown
<p>
the out-sailing ship be crowded with colonist ; gambler tout pimp dissenter papist-all to own the land and none to work he
the slave ship of portugal and the netherlands could not move black flesh from africa fast enough to supply the increase demand of those who clamour for worker
<p>
then felon be gather out of the prison and vagrant from the street of london ; beggar who stand all day before the church door ; those suspect of witchcraft or treason or leprosy or papism ; and all these be send to work the plantation under order of indenture
he be a brilliant plan ; the labor need be supply and the crown actually receive money for the worthless body of those he once feed and clothe and hang
more could be make of this
whole sheave of order of indenture ready seal by the government with blank space for name be sell to certain captain of ship
he be give instructions to act with extreme discretion about the name he fill in
<p>
and row of coffee and orange and cane and cocoa grow and ever spread out on the island
there be some little trouble of course when the terms of indenture run out
but the slum of london breed new slave quickly enough god know ! and the kingbolt be never without a fine supply of enemy
<p>
england be becoming a sea power with he governor and palace and clerk in the new world and ship of manufacture thing be sailing out of liverpool and bristol in ever increase number
<p>

with breaking day henry be in the outskirts of cardiff all he terror go and a new blossom wonder in he
for he be an unbelievable thing this city of house rank on rank-no two of them exactly alike-the lines of them stretch out endlessly like an army in the mud
he have never considered such magnitude when people spoke of city
<p>
the shop be opening he shutter putt he goods on display and henry stare wide-eyed into every one as he pass
down a long street he go until he came at last to the dock with he field of mast like grow wheat and he cloud and cobwebs of brown rigging in an apparent frenzy of disorder
there be loading of bundle and barrel and slaughter animal into some of the ship and other be scend out of he curve belly goods in queer foreign box and sack of braided straw
a tremendous bustle of excitement live about the dock
the boy feel that holiday tingle which have come to he when man be putt up pavilion for a fair at home
<p>
a loud song burst out of a ship just get under weigh and the word be clear beautiful foreign word
the water slap smooth hull be a joy to he to the point of pain
he feel that he have come home again to a known love place after days and nights of mad delirium
now a great song of many voice came from the moving barque and he brown anchor rose from the water ; he sail drop from the yard and catch the morning wind
the barque slide from he berth and move softly down the channel
<p>
onward he walk to where the ship be careen showing weed and barnacle gather in many ocean hanging to he shine side
here be the short quick hammer of the calkers and the rasp of iron on wood and brusque command build up to roar by the speaking trumpet
<p>
when the sun be well up henry begin to feel hungry
he wander slowly back to the town to find he breakfast reluctant to leave the dock even for food
now the crimp be coming out of he hole and the sniffle gambler who prey on sailor
here and there a dishevel sleepy-eyed woman scurry homeward as though fear to be catch by the sun
seaman on shore leave rub he puff eyes and look into the sky for weather sign as he lounge against the wall henry wonder what these man have see in the sailing days of he live
he step aside for a line of cart and tumbrel leaded with box and bail for the ship and immediately have to dodge another line coming away loaded with goods from across the sea
<p>
he came at last to a busy inn
"the three dogs" he be call and there he be on the sign look very like three startle dromedary
henry enter and found a large apartment crowded with people
of a fat man in an apron he ask whether he could get breakfast
<p>
"have he money?" the host ask suspiciously
<p>
henry let the light fall on a gold piece in he hand and as he have make the sign of power the apron be bowing and gently pull he by the arm
henry order he breakfast and stand look around the inn
<p>
there be a great many people in the room sitting at the long table or leaning against the wall ; some even be seat on the floor
a little serving girl go amongst them with a tray of liquor
some be italians from the ship of genoa and venice come with rare woods and spice that have be carry overland on camel back from the indian ocean to byzantium
frenchmen be there from the wine boat of bordeaux and calais with an occasional square-face blue-eyed basque amongst them
swede and danes and finns be in from the whaler of the north ocean dirty man who smell of decay blubber ; and at some of the table be cruel dutchmen who make a business of carry black slave from guinea to brazil
scatter amongst these foreign man be a few cambrian farmer look frighten and self conscious and alone
he have bring pig and sheep from the country for victual the ship and now be bolt he food so that he might get home again before nightfall
these look for security to three man of war man wearing the kingbolt uniform who talk together by the door
<p>
young henry lose himself in the lovely clamour of the room
he be hearing new speech and seeing new sight : the earring of the genoese ; the short knife-like sword of the dutch ; the colour of face from beet red to wind bite brown
all day he might have stand there with no knowledge in he of the passing of time
<p>
a big hand take he elbow a hand glove in callus ; and henry look down into the broad guileless face of an irish seaman
<p>
"will he be sitting here young man alongside of an honest sailor out of cork name tim?"
as he spoke he squeeze violently against he neighbour fling he sideways and leave a narrow space on the bench end for the boy
there be no man like the irish for be brutally gentle
and henry as he take the seat do not know that the sailor out of cork bad see he gold piece
<p>
"thank he " he say
"and where be he that he go sailing?"
<p>
"ah ! any place that ship go i do be sailing " reply tim
"i'm an honest sailor out of cork with no fault on he save never have the shine of a coin to he pocket
and i wonder now how i'm to be pay for the fine breakfast and he with never a shine " he say slowly and emphatically
<p>
"why if he have no money i'll buy he breakfast-so he will be telling he of the sea and ship "
<p>
i know he be a gentleman he be " tim cry
"i know he the minute he eyes landed on he soft like-and a small drink to be start with?"
he shout for he drink without wait for henry consent and when he came raise the brown liquor to he eyes
<p>
"uisquebaugh the irish call he
that means water of life ; and the english call he 'whiskey'-only water
why ! if water have the fine body and honest glow of this it's sailing i would give up and take to swim ! "
he laugh uproariously and tip the glass up
<p>
"i'm going to the indies " henry observe with think to bring he back to talk of the sea
<p>
"the indies?
why so be i tomorrow in the morning ; and for barbados with knife and sickle and diving goods for the plantation
it's a good ship-a bristol ship-but the master a hard man all stiff with religion out of the colony at plymouth
hell-file he roar at he and call he prayer and repentance but i'm thinking there's joy in all the burning to he
we'll all burn a good time if he have he way
i do not understand the religion of he ; there's never an ave mary about he and so how can he be religion at all?"
<p>
"do he think-do he think perhaps-i could go in he ship with you?"
henry ask chokingly
<p>
the lid draw down over the ingenuous eyes of tim
<p>
"if he be ten pound he have " he say slowly and then seeing the sorrow on the boy face "five i mean
"i have something over four now " henry break in with sadness
<p>
"well and four might do he too
he give he he four pound and i'll be talk with the master
it's not a bad man when he get to be knowing he only queer and religious
no do be look at he like that
he come along with he
i would run off with the four pound of a boy that buy he breakfast at all "
he face bloomed with a great smile
<p>
"come " he say ; "let's be drink that he go with he in the bristol girl
uisquebaugh for he and wine of oporto for he ! "
then breakfast arrive and he fell to eating
after a few mouthful henry say :
"my name be henry morgan
what be he other name besides tim?"
<p>
and the sailor laugh heartily
<p>
"why if there be ever a name to he but tim he might find he kick around in a wheel rut at cork
the father and mother of he do not wait to be telling he he name
but tim be on he without give
tim be a kind of free name that he can just take and no one to mention he like the little paper the dissenter be leave in the street and he scuttle off not to be see with them
he can breathe tim like the air and no one to put hand on he "
<p>
breakfast over he go into the street busy with the trade of carter and orange boy and peddle old woman
the town be crying he thousand wares and he seem that delicate thing fro the far unearthly corner of the world have be bring by the ship and dump like clod on the dusty counter of cardiff : lemon ; case of coffee and tea and cocoa ; bright eastern rug ; and the weird medicine of india to make he see thing that be not and to feel pleasure that fly away again
standing in the street be barrel and earthen jug of wine from the bank of the loire and the peruvian slope
<p>
he came again to the dock and the beautiful ship
the smell of tar and sunburnt hemp and the sweetness of the sea breathed in to them from off the water
at last far down the row henry saw a great black ship and bristol girl paint in letters of gold on he prow
and the town and all the flat hulk become ugly and squalid beside this beauty of the sea
the curve running lines of he and the sensuous sureness of he be tonic thing to make he gasp in he breath with pleasure
new white sail cling to he yard like long slender cocoon of silk worms and there be fresh yellow paint on he deck
he lay there lift slightly on a slow swell champ impatient to be flying off to any land of he imagination
a black sheban queen he be amongst the dull brown boat of the harbour
<p>
"oh it's a grand ship-a fine ship " cry henry wonder-struck
<p>
tim be proud
"but only come aboard of he and see the fitting-all new
i'll be talk with the master about he "
<p>
henry stand in the waist while the big seaman walk aft and pull he cap before a lean skeleton of a man in a wear uniform
<p>
"i have a boy " he say though henry could not hear ; "a boy that's set he heart on the indies and i'm thinking he might be liking to take he sir "
<p>
the hungry master scowl at he
<p>
"is he a strong boy who might be some good in the island bo's'n?
so many of them die within the mouth and there he have trouble the next trip "
<p>
"he be there behind he sir
he can see he himself standing there-and very well make and close knit he be too "
<p>
the hungry master appraise henry running he eyes from the sturdy leg to the full chest
he approval grow
<p>
"he be a strong boy all right ; and good work for he tim
he shall have drink money of he and a little extra ration of rummy at sea
but do he know anything about the arrangement?"
<p>
"never a bit "
<p>
"well then do tell he
put he to working in the galley
he'll think he's working out he passage
no use of caterwaul and disturb the man off watch
let he find out when he get there "
the master smile and pace away from tim
<p>
"you can be going with he in the ship " the sailor cry and henry could not move for he pleasure
"but " tim continue seriously "the four pound be not enough for passage
you'll be working a bit in the galley and he sailing "
<p>
"anything " henry say "anything i'll do so only i can go with he "
<p>
"then let himself go ashore and have a toast to a fine free voyage ; uisquebaugh for he and that same grand wine for he "
<p>
he sit in a dusty shop who wall be line with bottle of all shape and volume little pudgy flask to giant demijohn
after a time he sing together beating out the measures with he hands and smile foolishly at each other
but at length the warm wine of oporto fill the boy with a pleasant sadness
he feel that there be tears coming to he eyes and he be rather glad of he
he would show tim that he have he sorrow-that he be not just a feather-head boy with a crave to go to the indies
he would reveal he depth
<p>
"do he know tim " he say "there be a girl i came away from and he be name elizabeth
he hair be gold-gold like the morning
and on the night before i came away i call to he and he came to he in the dark ; the dark be all about he like a tent and cold
he cry and cry for he to stay even when i tell he of the fine thing and the trinket and the silk i would bring back to he in a little time
he would not be comfort at all and it's a sad thing on he to be thinking of he crying there for he leave "
the full tears came into he eyes
<p>
"i know" say tim softly
"i know it's a sad thing to a man to be leave a girl and running off to sea
have i left hundred of them-and all beautiful?
but here's another cup to he boy
wine be good to a woman than all the sweet paste of france and a man drink he
wine make every woman lovely
ah ! if the homely one would only put out a little font of wine in the door of he house like the holy water to a church there would be more marriage in the town
a man would never know the lack he have for look
but have another cup of the grand wine sad boy and he may be a princess and he leave he behind he "
<p>
1 2 2 ii
he be start for the indies-the fine far indies where boy dream live
the great sun of the morning lay struggle in grey mist and on the deck the seaman swarm like the angry populace of a break hive
there be short order and sailor leap up the shroud to edge along the yard
circle man be sing the song of the capstan while the anchor rose out of the sea and cling to the side like brown dripping moth
<p>
off for the indies-the white sail know he as he fling out and fill delicately as silken thing ; the black ship know he and ride proudly on the flee tide before a fresh little morning wind
carefully the bristol girl creep out of the shipping and down the long channel
<p>
the mist be slowly mix with the sky
now the coast of cambria become blue and pale blue until he fade into the straight horizon like a mad vision of the desert
the black mountain be a cloud and then a trifle of pale smoke then cambria be go as though he have never be
<p>
porlock he pass on the port side and illfracombe and many vague village tuck in the fold of devon
the fair sweet wind carry them by stratton and camelford
cornwall be slip off behind them league on blue league
then land end the pointed tip of britain's chin ; and as he rounded to the southward winter came in at last
<p>
the sea rose up and snarl at them while the ship run before the crying dog of the wind like a strong confident stag run bravely under courses and spritsail
the wind howl out of winter home in the north and the bristol girl mock he across he face to the southwest
he be cold ; the freeze shroud twang in the wind like great harp string pluck by a demented giant and the yard groan he complaint to the tug sail
<p>
four wild days the persistent storm chase them out to sea with the ship in joy at the struggle
the seaman gather in the forecastle to boast of he fleetness and the tight shape of he
and in this time henry exult like a young god
the wind frenzy be he frenzy
he would stand on the deck brace against a mast face into the wind cutting he with he chin as the prow cut the water and a chant exultation fill he chest to burst joy like a pain
the cold wipe off the lens of he eyes so that he saw more clearly into the drawn distance lie in a circle around he
here be the old desire surfeit with a new ; for the wind bring longing to have sweeping wing and the whole endless sky for scope
the ship be a rock quake prison for he who would fly ahead and up
ah ! to be a god and ride on the storm ! not under he
here be the intoxication of the wind a desire which satisfy desire while he lead he yearning onward
he cry for the shoulder of omnipotence and the element blow into he muscle a new strength
<p>
then as quickly as the devil servant of the year have rush at them he slink away leave a clear clean sea
the ship ride under full sail before the eternal trade wind
he be a fresh fair wind out of heaven breathed by the god of navigation for the tall ship with sail
all the tension be go from them ; the sailor play about the deck like wild strong child-for there be young happiness in the trade wind
<p>
sunday came a day of sullen fear and foreboding on the bristol girl
henry finished he work in the galley and go on deck
an aged seaman be sitting on a hatch plait a long splice
he finger seem each a nimble intelligence as he worked for he master never look at them
instead he small blue eyes after the manner of sailor eyes look out beyond the end of thing
<p>
"so he would know the secret of the lines?" he say without moving he gaze from the horizon
"well he musth just watch
it's so long i've be doing he that he old head have forget how ; only he finger remember
if i think what i'm doing i get muddle up
will he be a sailor and go aloft one day?"
<p>
"why i'd like to if i could learn the working " henry say
<p>
"it's not so hard to learn the working
he musth learn first to bear thing that landsman never hear of
that's the first thing
it's very cruel but he may never leave he once he start
here i've be trying to take he old hulk ashore and berth he in front of a fire for a dozen year
i want to think awhile and die
but it's no use
every time i find himself running he leg off to get aboard some ship or other "
<p>
he be interrupted by a vicious ring of the ship bell
<p>
"come " he say "the master will be telling he the hot ta1es now "
<p>
the skull-face master stand before he crew armed with he god
the man look fearfully at he as small bird gaze at an approach snake for he faith be in he eyes and word of fury fell from he thin lip
<p>
"god have strike he with only the title of he shatter might " he shout
"he have show he the strength of he little finger that he may repent before he go scream in hell-fire
hear the name of the lord in the frightful wind and repent he of he whorings and he blasphemy !
ah !
he will punish he even for the wicked thought in he heads
<p>
"there be a parable in the sea that should close about he throat like a freeze hand and choke he with the terror
but now the storm be done he have forget he
he be happy and contrition be not in he
but take warning of the lesson of the lord
repent !
repent ! or the wrath destroy he "
<p>
he swing he arms wildly and spoke of the poor lonely dead suffering and burning for dear human fault ; and at last he send he man terrify away
<p>
"that be not so " say the old sailor fiercely to henry
"do not be taking stock in he crazy talk
who make the storm-god or devil-make he for himself and take joy of he
what be could hurl the wind so would not be bother himself about a chip of a boat floating in immensity
i know i would not if i be that god or devil "
<p>
the boatswain tim have come up with he last word and now he take henry arm protectingly
<p>
"true for he " he say ; "but do not let he get back to he that he say such thing or even hear them with he ear or he will be demonstrate the might of god to he with a rope end
he and he god be a hard pair to be get down on he and he a boy scrub pot in the galley "
<p>
the trade wind blow on unceasingly and when he scour and peeling be done henry talk with the man while he lay hand to the rope and go aloft and learned the name and working of the ship gear
the sailor found he a quiet courteous boy with a way of look at them as though he speech be a great gift and he wise kind man to be give he to he ; and so he teach he what he could for very plainly this boy be born to the sea
he learned the short and long haul chantey the one quick and nervous and the other a slow swing rhythm
he sing with them the song of death and mutiny and blood in the sea
to he lip came the peculiar clean swear of sailor ; phrase of filth and blasphemy and horror washed white by he utter lack of meaning in he mouth
<p>
and in the nights he lay back quietly while the man talk of wonder see and imagine ; of mile-long serpent which coil about ship and crush and swallow them and of turtle so huge that he have tree and stream and whole village on he back and only sink once in five hundred year
under the swing lamp he tell how finns could whistle up a deadly storm for he revenge ; how there be sea-rat that swim to the ship and gnaw hole through the planking until the ship sink
he spoke shudderingly of how one sight the dread slimy kraken might never see land again for the curse that be on he
water spout be in he speech and mooing cow that live in the sea and suckle he calve like land cow ; and ghost ship sailing endlessly about the ocean look for a lose port he gear worked by seaman who be bleach skeleton
and henry lie there reach breathless for he word with he avidity
<p>
"on such a night tim stretch himself and say "i know nothing of he big snake at all nor have i see the kraken god save he !
but i've a bit of a tale himself if you'll be listen
<p>
" 'twas when i be a boy like this one here and i sailing in a free ship that tuck about the ocean pick up here and there-sometimes a few black slave and now and then a gold ring from a spanish craft that could help himself-whatever he could get
he have a master by election and no paper at all but there be different kind of flagstone and he on the bridge
if he do be pick out a man of war in the glass then he run for he
<p>
"well anyway as i'm telling he one morning there be a little barque to the starboard and he wet sail to run he down ; and so he do too
spanish he be and little enough in he but salt and green hide
but when he turn out the cabin there be a tall straight woman with black hair to he and a long white forehead and the slender finger i ever look on with he eyes
so he take he aboard of he and do take the rest
the captain be for leading the woman to the quarter deck alongside of he when the boatswain step up
<p>
"we're a free crew ' he say 'and he the master by election
he want the woman too ' he say and if he do be get he there'll be a bit of mutiny in a minute '
the captain scowl around but there be the crew scowl back at he ; so he pull up he shoulder and laugh-a nasty kind of laugh
<p>
" 'how will he be deciding?' he ask thinking there would be a grand fight over the woman
but the boatswain slip some dice out of he pocket and throw them on the deck
<p>
" 'we'll use these ! ' he say and in a minute every man of the crew be on he knee and reach for the dice
but 1 be taking a long sight of the woman there alone
i say to himself 'that do be a hard kind of woman and one that might be doing cruel thing to hurt the man he hate
no he boy ' i say 'you'd good not be coming in on the game '
<p>
"but just then the dark woman run to the rail and pick a round shot out of the rack and jump overside hug he in he arms
that be all !
he run to the rail and look-but only a few bubble there be to show
<p>
"well he be two nights later the afterwatch be for running into the forecastle and the hair bristle up on he head
'there's a white thing and he swim after he ' he say 'and the look on he like the woman that go overboard '
<p>
"of course he run and look over the taffrail and i could see nothing at all ; but the other say there be a thing with long white hands reach out for he stern post not swim but just drag after he like the ship be lodestone and he a bit of iron he can know there be little enough sleep that night
those that do dust off cry and moan in he sleep ; and i need not tell he what that same thing signify
<p>
"the next night up come the boatswain out of the hole scream like a mad one and the hair all turn grey on he head
he do be holding he and pet he awhile and finally he manage to whisper
" 'i see he !
oh he god i see he !
there be two long white soft look band with slender finger-and he came through the side and start to ripping the plank off like he be paper
oh he god !
save he ! '
<p>
"then he feel the ship give a list and start to settle down
<p>
"well three of he came floating ashore on an extra spar and two of them crazed-poor soul-and wild like cat
i never do be hearing whether any other be save or not but i'm thinking not
and that's the near i've ever see with he eyes the thing he do be talk of
but he say on clear nights in the indian ocean he can be seeing the poor murder hindu ghost chase the dead credendum gama about in the sky
and i have hear that these same hindus be a very unfruitful people to pick out and he going in for murder "
<p>
from the first day the cook have take he upon himself "to instruct young henry
the man seem to crave to give information
he be a wistful instruction as though be fear every minute to be contradict
he be a grey man the cook with sad brown eyes like a dog eyes
there be something of a priest about he and something of a dull lecturer and something of a thug
he speech have the university in he and he unclean habit the black bitter alley of london
he be gentle and kind and stealthily insincere
no one would ever give he a chance to prove himself trustworthy because the whisper seem to come from he that if he be in the least worthwhile he would be treacherous
<p>
now he have sail into a warm sea and a warm wind drive them on
henry and the cook would stand at the rail watch the triangle fin of shark cut back and forth across he wake wait for refuse
he saw little brown cluster of weed go floating by and the leisurely straight swim pilot fish on the point of the prow
once the cook pointed to the brown bird with long slender wing following them ; hanging hover dip sway always flying never resting
<p>
"see these restless one " the man say
"like quest soul he be indeed and some say he be the soul of sailor drown soul so thick with sin that he never rest from one year to another
other swear that these bird lay he egg in floating nest build on plank of lose ship ; and other still that he have no nest at all but be born full grown of the white lip of a wave and instantly start he lifelong flight
aye ! the restless one "
<p>
the ship start a school of flier that skip along the wave tops like shine silver coin
<p>
"these be the ghost or treasure lose at sea " the cook go on "the murder thing emerald and diamond and gold ; the sin of man commit for them stick to them and make them haunt the ocean
aye ! it's a poor thing if a sailor will not make a grand tale about he "
<p>
henry pointed to a great tortoise asleep on the surface
"and what be the tale of the turtles?" he ask
<p>
"nothing ; only food
he be not likely that a man will be making romance about the thing he eats
such thing be too close to he and the romance contaminate out of them
but these same beast have be the saving of a number of ship and the means of making flesh on some that might otherwise be white bone on the deck of a derelict the meat of turtle be sweet and good
sometimes when the buccaneer be not in the way of get wild beef he stock he ship with these and so sail "
<p>
the sun have rush below the water as he spoke
far off one black cloud whip out tongue after tongue of dazzle lightning but all the sky save that one spot be silken blue-black litter with swarm of star
<p>
"you promise to speak with he of those same buccaneer " henry beg ; "they who he call the brethren of the coast
tell he do he ever sail with them?"
<p>
the cook shift uneasily
"there's peace between spain and england " he say
"i would not be breaking the kingbolt peace
no i never sail with them ; no
but i have hear thing which may be true
i have hear that the buccaneer be great fool
he plunder rich prise and then throw he gains to the tavern host and brothel keeper of tortuga and goaves like child throw sand from them when he be tire of play
oh ! great fool i think "
<p>
"but do none of them ever take a town?"
henry ask
<p>
"a village or so have fall to them but he have no leader for such a thing "
<p>
"but a great town with a treasury?"
henry persist
<p>
"no he have never done he
he be child i tell he-strong brave child "
<p>
"could not a man who think and plan carefully take a spanish town?"
<p>
"ho ! " the cook laugh ; "and be he going to be a buccaneer?"
<p>
"but if a man plan carefully?"
<p>
"why if there be a buccaneer who could plan at all carefully or otherwise he might be done ; but there be no such buccaneer
he be little child who can fight like hell and die very nicely-but fool
he will sink a ship for a cup of wine when he might sell the ship "
<p>
"if a man considered carefully and weigh he chance and the man he have he might
"yes i suppose he might "
<p>
"there be one call pierre le grand who be no fool "
<p>
"ah but pierre take one rich ship and then run home to france !
he be a fearful gambler not a wise man
and he may yet come back to the coast and lose he all and he head too "
<p>
"still " say henry with a grown finality "still i think he could be done so only a man think about he and considered he "
<p>
in a few days he be coming close to land
one morning the pale ghost of a mountain be sitting on the edge of the circle
log and branch of tree go floating by now and again and land bird fly out to them and rest in the rigging
<p>
he be come to the home of summer whence he go yearly to the northern place
in the day the sun be a glaring brass cymbal the sky washed out and livid around he and at night the big fish swim about the ship with curve river of pale fire flow behind them
from off the forepeak be hurl million of flying diamond by the rage prow
the sea be a round lake of quiet undulation spread with a silken skin
slowly slowly passing to rearward the water set up a pleasant hypnosis in the brain
he be like look into a fire
one saw nothing yet only with infinite struggle could he move he eyes ; and finally he brain dream off though he be not sleep
<p>
there be a peace in the tropic ocean which pass a desire for understanding
destination be no longer an end but only to be sailing sailing out of the kingdom of time
for month and year he seem to slip onward but there be no impatience in the crew
he do he work and lay about the deck all in a strange happy lethargy
<p>
one day there be a little island floating in the sea shape like a haycock and green as the first spear of barley
he be thickly cover with a tangle fierce growth vine and creeper and a few dark tree
henry saw he with eyes that look out on enchantment
he pass that island and another and another until at last in the blackness of a tropic early morning the ship came in to barbados
he anchor splash into the sea and go tug down with the hawser flying behind them
<p>
on the shore there be lettuce green jungle as on the little island and farther back plantation with straight lay row and white house with red roof ; farther still the red soil showing like wound through the jungle of the hill ; and far behind mountain that rose sharp and hard with the appearance of strong grey tooth
<p>
small dug-out boat came to them bearing rich fruit and piles of truss up fowl
he came to sell and to buy or steal that which the ship carry
shine black man sing rich cadenced chant as he pull at the oar and henry close against the rail be overjoy with the new land
he be more than he have hope
the sight bring happy silly tears to he eyes
<p>
tim be standing near look crest-fallen and sad
at length he came and stand in front of henry
<p>
"it's grieve he to be hurt a fine boy that buy he breakfast " he say
"it's grieve he so i can sleep "
<p>
"but he have not hurt he " cry henry
"you've bring he to the indies where i want to be so badly "
<p>
"ah ! " say tim sorrowfully "if only i have a religion to he like the master i might say ''tis god will '-and then be forget about he
and if i have a business or position i might be talk how a man musth live
but i have no religion in he at all save only an ave mary or a miserere dominie in storm ; and as to position why i'm only a poor sailor out of cork and he do be grieve he to hurt a boy that buy he breakfast and he a stranger "
he be watch a long canoe that draw near to them six strong caribs row he
in the stern sit a little nervous englishman who face have not tan with the year but have grown redder and redder until the tiny vein seem to be running on the outside of he skin
in the little man pale eyes there be the light of perpetual indecision and perplexity
he canoe bump the ship side and he climb slowly aboard and go directly to the master
<p>
"these he be now " cry tim ; "and he will not be thinking too badly about he will he henry-seeing the grief he do me?"
<p>
the captain be shout "galley boy !
oh galley boy !
morgan !
aft ! "
<p>
henry go back to where the englishman and the captain be standing
he be amaze when the little colonist gingerly feel he arms and shoulder
<p>
"i might give ten " he say to the captain
<p>
"twelve ! " the captain snap
<p>
"but do he really think he be worth it?
i'm not a rich man he see and i just think that ten
"well he may have he for eleven but as god see he he's worth more
look at the knit of he and the broad shoulder
he will die like so many
no sir he's worth more but he may have he for eleven "
<p>
"well if he really think so " the planter say hesitantly ; and he begin pull money out of he pocket money that be mixed with tangle string and piece of chalk and a bit of a quill pen and a break key
<p>
the master draw a paper from he pocket and show he to the boy-an order of indenture for five year with the name henry morgan nicely fill in and the british seal at the bottom
<p>
"but i do want to be sell " cry henry
"i do come to be sell
i want to make he fortune and be a sailor "
<p>
"so he shall " the master answer kindly as though he give permission "after five year
now go along with the gentleman and let he have no caterwaul
do he think i could run this ship just bring out boy that want to come to the indies?
he do he work and trust in god and he may be a very good thing for he
experience be never waste on the sharp albeit humble soul "
he pushed henry soothingly along the deck in front of he
<p>
at last the boy found he voice
"tim " he cry "tim
they're selling he tim
oh tim come to he ! "
but there be no answer
tim hear and he be sob in he hammock like a small whip child
<p>
and henry as he climb over the side ahead of he new master feel nothing at all
but for a little catching in he throat there be no sharp feeling in he-only a heavy sodden dullness
<p>
1 2 3 iii
so henry morgan came to be living in barbados by authority of a white paper which forced he life and soul and body to kneel before the pleasure of one james flower planter
<p>
james flower be not a hard man and certainly he be not a very brilliant man
he whole life have be a hunger for idea-any idea-the creation of them
he want to conceive idea to warm them to throb life then to hurl them on an astonish world
he would go bob like stone start down a long hill awakening an avalanche of admiration
but no idea came to he
<p>
he father have be a stolid english curate who write stout sermon which be actually publish though very few ever buy them
he mother write poetry which be a kind of summary of the sermon
he verse be append to the volume of rugged orthodoxy
and both he father and mother have idea
both be creator in a small way
<p>
james flower bad be rear in an atmosphere of
"i musth be walking to he publisher now helen ! "
<p>
"but william a glorious thing burst upon he this morning as i be doing he hair-such a conception !
he musth surely have come from god
he will be done in couplet i think
oh ! glorious !
and he just fit in with those delightful word of he on humility "
<p>
"ah well ; i musth be walking to he publisher now to see how the sermon be going
i send a copy to the archbishop and he may have be talk about them
such a thing would start a great sale i think "
<p>
yes he be people with idea and often he shake he heads over he dull son
he have hold them in awe have be frighten at he greatness and ashamed of himself
and so early in he life he have make a determination to have idea
he reading have be tremendous
kingbolt james' "defense of witchcraft" came into he hands and he set about to prove he true
with the aid of ancient incantation and a black lotion which contain a number of filthy ingredient together with a large amount of hashish he attempt to fly from the roof of he house
he be while he two break leg be heal that he came on scot "discoverie of witchcraft "
<p>
the system of descartes be cause a stir amongst learned man and james flower too determined to reduce all philosophy to a basic postulate
he lay out paper and a number of fine pen at he side but he could never come on he postulate
"i think therefore i be " he say ; "at least i think i be "
but this lead in a circle and get he nowhere
then he join the new-found school of bacon
with persistent experiment he burned he finger and try to cross clover with barley and pull the leg from numberless insect strive to discover something-almost anything ; but he never do
as he have a moderate income from money left he by an uncle he experiment be varied and extensive
<p>
a separatist of fanatic intensity have write a violent book of the good scientific manner-the effects of alcoholic spirit momentary and perpetual
this work fell into the hands of james flower and he set out one evening to verify some of he more fantastic theory
in the midst of he investigation the spirit of induction left he and without cause or warning he assault one of he majesty guardsman with a potted plant
have he only known he this be the one spontaneous idea of he life
the matter be hush up by an archdeacon who be related to he mother
james flower small fortune be invest in a plantation in barbados and he be send to live there
clearly he do not fit in with orthodoxy and pentameter
<p>
and so he have grown wistfully old on the island
he library be the fine in the indies and as far as information go he be the most learned man anywhere about
but he learning form no design of the whole
he have learned without absorbing remember without assimilate
he mind be a sad mass of unrelated facts and theory
in he brain as on he shelve caesar's commentary stand shoulder to shoulder with democritus and a treatise on spontaneous generation
james flower who have cry to be a creator become a quiet kindly little gentleman somewhat ineffectual and very inefficient
in he later year he have begin to mistake conviction for idea
if a man stated any belief loudly enough he frighten james flower for he say to himself "here be one of those divinely endow creature who control the fire i lack altogether "
<p>
1 2 4 iv
there be few white man on the great green plantation and those who do grub there be sullen tatter wretch serving for some forget felony against the crown
within he body the fever lay like a light sleeper who wake and snarl then sleep again with one malicious eye unclose
he knead the soil in the field with he finger and as he year of servitude crawl on he eyes deaden he shoulder slump and a tire dull imbecility stretch cloy web in he brain
he language be a bastard argot of london with a few word from the guinea negroes and a few clatter carib phrase
when these man be loose from he slavery he wander listlessly about for a time and watch the other go to work with something of longing
then after a little he either sign new paper of indenture or go maraud like tiger from a break cage
<p>
the overseer have be one of them and now that he command those who have be he fellow he inflict suffering in memory of he own pain
<p>
james flower bring henry to the shore and something in the boy silent misery touched the planter
he have never be able to think of he slave as man before
he have blindly follow the injunction of the shrewd elder cato in deal with he slave
but here be one who be very obviously a human and possibly a gentleman
this boy have cry that he do want to be a slave
the other always landed knowing he lot and display a sullen rancour which musth be beat out of them on the cross
<p>
"do not be so hurt child " the planter say
"you be very young to be coming to the island
in a few year he will be a man and strong "
<p>
"but he be on he to be a buccaneer " say henry dully
"i came out to the sea to make he fortune and a name
and how can i do these thing if i be a slave toil in the fields?"
<p>
"i do not intend that he shall toil in the field
i want he-i want a boy to be about the house now i be grow old
i want a-a kind of companion who would talk with he and hear he talk
the other planter come to the house and drink he wine but when he leave i think he laugh at he and laugh at he book-he lovely book
and so he will sit with he in the evenings perhaps and he will talk of the thing in book
he father be a gentleman i think
he have the look
<p>
"now today " james flower go on mildly "we have a hanging and he and i musth hurry to be there
i do just know what the fellow do but he be enough
and what say-oh ! what's he name?
i have read he anyway chief value of violent punishment lie with those on who the same might fall '
yes i think he be well to have some one hang every now and then
he be expensive but very conducive to good behaviour amongst the rest
but he overseer attend to all that
do he know i think he really enjoy ii "
<p>
he lead the boy to a square of thatch mud hut build close together each with he door opening out into a kind of plaza
and in the center of the square like a horrible fetish rose a tall gallows make of black wood and polished with oil until he shine dully in the sunlight
he be so place that no slave could look out of he hovel without seeing the black horror that might be he end
this be the overseer work
with he own hands he have rub the dark wood until he glow
he be accustomed to stand and gaze at he head cock to one side as an artist might look at he new finished work
<p>
the planter and the boy seat himself
the slave be herd into the square
and henry saw a naked black figure squirm and writhe at the end of a rope while the negroes rock himself back and forth on the ground and moan ; while the white slave grit he tooth and cursed harshly to keep from shriek
the caribs squat on he ham and watch with no particular interest and no fear
thus he might squat and watch the fire which cook he food
<p>
when he be all over and the black victim hang limply by he crooked neck the planter look down and saw that henry be crying nervously
<p>
"i know he be bad the first time " lie say gently "when i first saw he i do not sleep for a good while
but after a little when he have see five ten-a dozen-go out in this way he will come to have no feeling about he and no more think of he than of a chicken flop about with a wring neck "
<p>
henry breath still came in little miserable choke
<p>
"i can show he in the works of holmaron on the practice of the inquisition a dissertation on this very thing he feel
'the first time one see human suffering ' he say 'it be an unnatural thing because within one experience placid comfortable people be the rule
but after a number of such experience the sight of torture become a normal thing and normal humans come to relish he to various extent '
remind he to show he the passage sometime ; though i musth say i have never come to relish the matter "
<p>
in the evenings of the month that came the two of them sit in the black depth of the veranda and james flower pour he unrelated facts into the ear of young henry morgan
the boy listen eagerly for often the planter spoke of ancient war and he conduct
<p>
"and be these thing in the book that line the walls?"
henry ask one night
<p>
"all of these thing and oh ! many thousand of thing more "
<p>
after a time henry beg "would he be teaching he the language of the book sir?
there musth be thing there i should like to read for himself "
<p>
james flower be delighted
in teaching this boy the thing he have read he have come near to satisfaction than ever before
he heart be warm toward the young slave
<p>
"the latin and the greek ! " he cry with enthusiasm
"you shall learn them from he ; and the hebrew too if he wish "
<p>
"i want to read the book of war and sailing " young henry say
"i want to read of those old war he speak of for one day i shall be a buccaneer and take a spanish town "
<p>
and in the month that follow he learned the language very rapidly because of he wish to read the book
james flower plunge more deeply into he volume than ever for he new role of teacher be very dear experience to he
<p>
after a little while he would say
"henry will he tell the overseer to gather the molasses on the beach?
a ship be in to buy he "
and later still
"henry be there anything i should be doing today?"
<p>
"well sir there's a great ship down there in from the netherlands
he be in strong need of sickle
the caribs have steal nearly all the old one to make sword with
he shall have trouble with those caribs one day sir "
<p>
"well see to the sickle will he henry?
i hate to be moving in this sun
and have the indians punish if he steal thing
attend to that too will you?"
<p>
little by little henry be absorbing the management of the plantation
<p>
one evening after henry have be there a year he gain the paramount respect of james flower ; rather a wistful respect though he lose no love by he
<p>
"have he considered these ancient wars?"
henry ask
"i have be reading of alexander and xenophon and caesar in he war
and the think be on he that battle and tactics-that be successful tactics-be nothing more than a glorify trickery
the force be necessary and the arms of course ; but the war be really win by the man who sit back like one cheat at card and confound the enemy with he trickery
have he considered that sir?
any one who can guess the mind of ordinary general as i can guess the mind of the slave can win battle
such a man would have only to shun what be expect of he
be that the secret of tactics sir?"
<p>
"i have not think of he " say james flower just a trifle jealously
and that awe he feel for people of idea go out to henry
but the planter take great comfort in telling himself that after all he be the teacher who have awaken these idea
<p>
two year after henry have come the overseer be release by the year from he bondage
he found he freedom too strong a drug for the mind that have be used to outside control
that mind snap and fury flood in on he so that he go shout along the road striking at every passer-by
and in the night he mania become a terrible frantic thing
he roll on the ground under he gallows and bloody foam froth from he mouth while the slave look on in terror
at length he arise with ragged hair and maniac flaming eyes
he seize a torch and rush into the field
and henry morgan shot he dead as he enter the close grow row of cane
<p>
"who know the work as well as i do and who can he trust more sir?" young henry ask the planter
"i have learned thing in the book and from he watch that will make this plantation a hundred time more productive "
<p>
thus he become much more than the overseer
<p>
henry removed the gallows from the square and after that the hanging be done secretly in the night
this be not kindness
he know out of he own reasoning that the unknown thing can never become the normal thing ; that unseen punishment could be far more horrible to the remain slave than those see under the light of the sun
<p>
henry have learned many thing in deal with the slave
he know that he musth never let them see what he be thinking for then in some ineffable way he have a hold on he which would be difficult to shake off
he musth be cold and distant and insult to those below he
with few exception he would take insult as the sign of he superiority
man always believe he what he seem to be and he could seem to be almost anything
<p>
if one be brilliantly dress all man presume he rich and powerful and treat he accordingly
when he say thing as though he mean them nearly all act as though he mean them
and most important of he lesson-if he be perfectly honest and give a strict accounting in nine consecutive dealings then the tenth time he might steal as much as he wish and no one would dream of suspect he so only he have bring the nine time forcibly enough to the attention of all man
<p>
a grow pile of golden coin in a box under he bed give ample proof of the validity of this last lesson
and he follow all he teaching
he never give any man the least hold on he nor insight into he motive and means and ability and short-coming
since most man do not believe in himself he could not believe in one he understand to be like himself
<p>
these rule he glean gradually from he life until he be master of the plantation until james flower pitifully lean on he advice and he conviction and until the caribs and black and felon white man hate and fear he and yet could make no dent in he be-could get no hold to hurt he
<p>
james flower be deliciously happy-happy than he have ever be-for this boy have lift the hideous weight of the plantation from he shoulder
he need think no more of the matter of till the soil
more and more he lay drown in he book
and now he be coming to be an old man he read the same book over and over again without knowing he
often he feel a slight irritation at the careless person who have make notes in he margin and dog eared the page
<p>
and henry morgan have get himself a great plantation and a great power
under he captaincy the earth flowered and increase
he be making the land give four time as much as he have before
the slave worked deliriously under the whips which follow them to the field but there be nothing personal in the whips
the old overseer have delighted in punishment but henry morgan be not cruel
he be merciless
he merely speed the wheels of he factory
one could not think of be kind to a sprocket or a fly-wheel and no more could this boy think of pamper he slave
<p>
henry be force money out of the ground and from he be add to he hoard in the box under he bed-a little from the season sale of cane and a trifle in the buy of new cattle
he be not steal but only a kind of commission for he success
the little pile of golden coin grow and grow for the time when henry morgan should go a and take a spanish town
<p>
1 2 5 v
henry have serve three year and though he be only eighteen he be grown and strong
he crisp black hair seem to curl more tightly to he head and he mouth from deal with the slave be more firm than ever
he gaze about he and know that he should be satisfy but he eyes have never lose the trick of look out beyond distance and over the edge of the present
a little hector wish run through he wake and dream like a thin red line
he musth get back to the sea and ship
the sea be he mother and he mistress and the goddess who might command and find he ready and alert for service
why he very name in the ancient briton tongue signify one who live by the sea
yes the ship be calling to he cruelly now
he heart sail out away from he with every passing merchantman
<p>
in the big house he have studied and considered what navigation there be in book and in the plantation little sloop he have go cruise in the near water
but this be the play of a child he think and he be not prepare he to be an expert sailor
he be necessary for he to learn avidly for in the near future he musth go a and take a spanish town
this be the silver throne of all he desire
<p>
and so one evening
"there be a thing i should like to be speaking of sir "
<p>
james flower raise he eyes from he book and lay he head back in the chair
<p>
"if he have a ship to carry he produce to jamaica " henry continue "we should be saving a large deal in freightage
the cost of such a ship would soon enough be eat away by the profit
too he might carry the produce of the other plantation at a small fee than the merchantman ask "
<p>
"but where might one come on such a ship?"
james flower inquired
<p>
"there be one in the harbour now one of two mast and
"then buy he ; buy he and see to he
he know more about these thing than i do
by the way here be an interesting conjecture on the inhabitant of the moon
'they may be totally unlike human being ' he read
'their neck could easily be "
"it will be seven hundred pound sir "
<p>
"what will be seven hundred pounds?
he seem not to pay attention as he used henry
do listen to this paragraph ; he be both entertaining and instructive
henry careen the ship and when he have scrape and paint he he name he elizabeth and put to sea
he have what be known as "hands" to a horseman a warm feeling of the personality of he boat
he musth learn the rule of navigation of course ; but even before that something of the spirit of the ship creep into he soul and part of he go back to he
he be a steadfast love a steady understanding of the sea
by the thrill of he deck and the smooth touch of the wheel he know instinctively how close he could bring he into the wind
he be like a man who lay he head on he mistress breast read the flux of he passion in he breathing
<p>
now he could have run away from barbados and go to plunder in the stanch elizabeth but there be no need
he hoard be not great enough and he be too young ; and in addition he feel a curious shame-face love for james flower
<p>
henry be content for a little while
the lust that all man have in vary degree-some for the flash of card and some for wine and some for the body of woman-be in henry morgan satisfy with the deck lunge and pitch and the crack of canvas
the wind blow out of a black dreadful sky be a cup of wine to he and a challenge and a passionate caress
<p>
he sail to jamaica with the crop and beat about amongst the island
the return from the plantation mounted and henry box of coin be grow heavy
<p>
but after a few month a dull torture desire came to he
he be the yearning of the little boy revivify and strong
the elizabeth have sate he old lust and left a new one
he think he be plunder that call he : the beautiful thing of silk and gold and the admiration of man and on these he heart set more zealously than ever
<p>
henry go to the brown woman and the black in the slave hut strive to dull he hunger if he could not satisfy he ; and he receive he cow eyed and passive anxious to please
he hope that of he favour he might receive more food or a jug of rummy as a gift
each time he came away with disgust and a little pity for he poor hopeful prostitution
<p>
once in the slave dock at port royal he found paulette and buy he for a servant in the house
he be lithe yet rounded ; fierce and gentle in a moment
poor little slave of the jumble blood he be spanish and carib and negro and french
the heritage of this rag-bag ancestry be hair like a cataract of black water eyes as blue as the sea set in oriental slit and a golden golden skin
he be a sensuous passionate beauty-limb that twinkle like golden flame
he lip could writhe like slender twist serpent or bloom like red flower
he be a little child yet old in life
he be a christian but he worship wood spirit and sing low chant in honour of the great snake
<p>
henry think of he as a delicate machine perfectly make for pleasure a sexual contraption
he be like those tall cool woman of the night who ride with the wing of sleep-soulless body-body of passionate dream
he build for he a tiny vine-clad house roof with banana leave and there he play at love
<p>
at first paulette be only grateful to he for bring he to a lazy easy life with comfort and days of little toil but later he fell frenziedly in love with he
he watch he face like a quick terrier wait to jump with wild pleasure at one word or fall fawn in the dust at another
<p>
when henry be serious or distraught he be afraid ; then he would kneel before he little ebony figure of a jungle god and pray to the virgin for he love
sometimes he put out cup of milk for the wing jun-jo-bee which keep man true
with the frantic tender arts of he mixed blood he strive to hold he surely in he sight
from he body and he hair there came a rich orient odour for he rub himself with sandalwood and myrrh
<p>
when he be gloomy
"do he love paulette?" he would ask
"do he love paulette?
be he sure he love paulette?"
<p>
"why certainly i love paulette
how could a man see paulette little dear paulette-how touch the lip of sweet paulette-and not be loving her?"
and he eyes would go wandering to the sea below seek and seek along the curve shore
<p>
"but do he surely surely love paulette?
come kiss the little breast of he own paulette "
<p>
"yes surely i love paulette
there !
i have kiss them and the charm be make
now do be still a little
hear the pound of the frog
i wonder what startle the old bearded monkey in the tree there ; some slave perhaps out steal fruit "
and he eyes would go wandering restlessly to sea
<p>
as the year go on the soil of he love thrust up strong vine of choke fear
he know that when he finally desert he he would be far more than just alone
he might be forced to kneel in the field row and dig about the plant with he finger as the other woman do
and then one day he would be lead to the hut of a great negro with powerful muscle and he would bruise he little golden body in he beast clutch and make he pregnant of a black child-a strong black child that could toil and strain in the sun when he be grown
this happen to all the other slave woman of the island
the half of he mind that be very old shudder at this think and that same old mind know well that henry would leave he one day
<p>
then to he child mind appear the doorway for the passage of he fright
if only he would marry he-impossible he seem yet stranger thing have be-if only he would marry he then he need never fear
for those strange being wive be in some curious way by some divine intent shield from ugly and uncomfortable thing
ah ! he have see them in port royal surround by he man to keep foul contact off breathing through scent cloth to deaden the vile smell and sometimes with little pellet of cotton in he ear to stop the curse of the street from enter
and paulette know-have he not be told?-that in he home he lay in great soft bed and languidly give order to he slave
<p>
this be the blessed state he dare to hope for
and he body be not enough he know
often he fail in he soft potency
if he feed he full of love he do not come again to he bower for a time ; and when he refuse he to make he passion mount either he go sullenly away or laugh and fling he roughly on the low palm couch
he musth cast about for some compelling force some very powerful means to make he marry he
<p>
when henry go away with cocoa for port royal he be scarcely sane
he know he love for the ship he passion for the sea and he be furiously jealous of them
in he mind he saw he fondle the wheel with the strong dear touch of lover finger
ah ! he could scratch and tear that wheel which rob he
<p>
he musth make he love paulette more than the ship more than the sea or anything on earth so that he would marry he
then he could walk haughtily amongst the hut and spit at the slave ; then he need never think of grub in the earth or bearing strong black child ; then he would have red cloth to wear and a silver chain to go about he neck
he be even possible that once in a long while he dinner might be bring to he while he lay in bed pretend to be ill
he wriggle he toe in delight at such a think and make up the insult thing he would say to one fat negress with a spiteful tongue when only he should be a wife
that old fat wretch have call paulette a slut before a gathering
paulette have pull out lots of hair before he could be hold with he arms to he side-but still that black one should see one day
paulette would have he whip on the cross
<p>
while henry be away a trade ship came into port and paulette go to the beach to see the thing he bring and to watch the wind-brown sailor come ashore
and one of them a great broad irishman lade with black rummy pursue and capture he against a pile of box
strong and quick he struggle to elude he but he hold he tightly sway though he be
<p>
"i've catch a fairy to mend he shoe " he laugh and peer into he face
"sure enough 'tis a fairy "
and then he saw that he be small and very beautiful and he spoke tenderly and low
<p>
"you're a lovely fairy-lovely than the eyes of he have ever see
could a slim little body like he be thinking anything about a great ugly hulk like he i wonder?
come off and marry he and he shall have anything 'tis in the power of a sailor to give he "
<p>
"no ! " he cry
"no ! " and slip under he arm and away
the sailor sit in the sand stare dully before he
<p>
" 'twas a dream " he whisper ; " 'twas only a dream from the spirit
there's no such thing to be happening to a poor sailor
no ; for sailor there be pretty hag with sharp hard eyes to say 'come ! money first sweetheart mine '
"
but now paulette have found the way to make henry many he
he would contrive to get drunkenness on he would traprock he with wine and there would be a priest nearby to come at he hush call
oh surely stranger thing have be !
<p>
he lay he snare for he on he first night back from sea-a large stone flagon fill with peruvian wine and a priest bribe with a steal coin wait in the shadow of a tree
henry be very tire
he have go out short-handed and help to work the ship himself
the little vine-clothe hut be a pleasant restful place to he
a full white moon cast silver splash in the sea below and strew the ground with scarves of purple light
sweetly there sing a little jungle breeze amongst the palm
<p>
he bring the wine and fill a cup for he
"do he love paulette?"
<p>
"ah yes ! as god see he i love paulette ; dear sweet paulette "
another cup and still persistently he so sure he love paulette?"
<p>
"paulette be a little star hanging to he breast by a silver chain "
<p>
another cup
<p>
"do he love none other save only he paulette?"
<p>
"i came longingly to find paulette ; the think of he sail on the sea with he "
and he arms lock tightly around he little golden waist
<p>
another and another and another ; then he arms fell away from he and he hands clench
the girl cry fearfully
"oh ! do he love paulette?" for henry have grown morose and strange and cold
<p>
"i shall tell he of an old time " he say hoarsely
"i be a little boy a joyous little boy yet old enough to love
there be a girl-and he be name elizabeth-the daughter of a wealthy squire
ah ! he be lovely as this night about he quiet and lovely as that slender palm tree under the moon
i love he with that love a man may exercise but once
even he hearts seem to go hand in hand
how i remember the brave plan he tell he and i there sitting on a hillside in the night
he be to live in a great house and have dear child grow up about he
he can never know such love paulette
<p>
"ah well !
he could not last
the god slay happiness in jealousy
nothing good can last
a gangue of bastard sailor roved through the land and carry he off-a little boy to be sell for a slave in the indies
he be a bitter thing to lose elizabeth-a bitter thing the year can forget "
and he be weeping softly by he side
<p>
paulette be bewilder by the change in he
he stroke he hair and he eyes until he breath came more calmly
then he begin again with almost helpless patience like a teacher questioning a dull child
<p>
"but-do he love paulette?"
<p>
he leap up and glare at he
<p>
"you?
love you?
why he be just a little animal ! a pretty little golden animal for sure but a forme of flesh no more
may one worship a god merely because he be big or cherish a land which have no virtue save he breadth or love a woman who whole realm be he flesh?
ah paulette ! he have no soul at all !
elizabeth have a white wing soul
i love you-yes-with what he have to be love-the body
but elizabeth-i love elizabeth with he soul "
<p>
paulette be puzzle
<p>
"what be this soul?" he ask
"and how may i get one if i have not one already?
and where be this soul of he that i have never see he or hear he at all?
and if he can be see or hear or touched how do he know he have this soul?"
<p>
"hush ! " he cry furiously
"hush ! or i box he mouth and have he whip on the cross
he speak of thing beyond he
what can he know of love that lie without he fleshly juggling?"
<p>

christmas came to the hot tropic the fourth christmas of henry servitude
and james flower bring he a small box done up with colored string
<p>
"it be a gift of the season " he say and he eyes sparkle with delight while henry untie the package
there be a little teakwood box and in he lie on the scarlet silk of he lining the tear fragment of he slavery
henry take the shred of paper from the box and stare at them and then he laugh unsteadily and put he head down on he hands
<p>

<p>
"that may not be " young henry cry
"i musth be off to make he a name
he be not give that i live a planter
sir there be plannings in he head that have grown perfect with ponder
and nothing may be allow to interfere with them "
<p>
james flower slump forward in he chair
<p>
"it will be very lonely here without he
i do quite know what i shall do without he "
<p>
henry mind carry he back to that old time with robert smile into the fire and saying these same word will be so lonely here without he son "
he wonder if he mother still sit coldly upright and silent
surely he would have get over he
people always get over the thing he fear so much
and then he think of small paulette who would be crying with terror in he hut when he tell he
<p>
"there be a little servant girl " he say ; "little paulette
i have protect he
and if i have ever please he will he do these thing for me?
always always keep he in the house and never let he be send to the field nor whip nor breed with any of the black

<p>
"of course i will " james flower say
"ah but he have be good to have he here henry-good to hear he voice in the evening
what will i do in the evening now?
there be none to take he place for he have very truly be he son
he will be lonely here without he boy "
<p>
say henry "the toil i have done in he service have be more than repay with the knowledge he have pour into he ear these same evenings
and i shall miss he sir more than i can say
but can he understand?
i musth go a and take a spanish town for the think be on he that if a man plan carefully and considered he chance and the man he have the thing might well be done
i have studied the ancient war and i musth be making a name for himself and a fortune
then when i have the admiration of man perhaps i shall come back to he sir and he may sit and talk again in the evenings
he will remember he wish about paulette?"
<p>
"who be paulette?" the planter ask
<p>
"why the servant girl i mention
never let he go with the slave because i be fond of he "
<p>
"ah yes !
i remember !
and where do he go now henry?"
<p>
"to jamaica
he uncle sir edward have long be lieutenant-governor there in port royal
but i have never see he-well because i be a bond servant and he be a gentleman
i have a letter to he that he father give he year past
perhaps he will help he to buy a ship for he plunder "
<p>
"i would help he buy a ship
he have be very good to he " the planter say hopefully
<p>
now henry be dip in a kind of shame for in the box under he bed there glisten a pile of golden coin-over a thousand pound
<p>
"no " he say "no ; i have more payment in he teaching and in the father he have be to he than money could ever equal "
now he be going henry know that he have grown to love this red-faced wistful man
<p>
strong glisten black pull at the oar of the canoe and he go skim toward an anchor ship a ship commissioned by the state-general to carry black slave from guinea to the island
james flower sitting in the canoe stern be very red and very silent
but as he near the ship side he lift up he head and spoke pleadingly to henry
<p>
"there be book on the shelve that he have never read "
<p>
"i shall come back one day and read them "
<p>
"there be thing in he mind i have never tell he boy "
<p>
"when i have the admiration of man i shall come to he and he shall tell them to he "
<p>
"you swear it?"
<p>
"well-yes i swear "
<p>
"and how long will he take he to do these thing henry?"
<p>
"i can tell ; one year-or ten-or twenty

henry be climbing over the ship side
<p>
"i shall be lonely in the evenings son "
<p>
"and i too sir

good-by sir
he will remember paulette?"
<p>
"paulette?
-paulette?
-ah yes ; i remember "
<p>
1 2 7 vii
henry morgan came to the english town of port royal and left he baggage on the beach while he go look for he uncle
<p>
"do he know where i may find the lieutenant he ask in the street
<p>
"his palace be yonder young man and who know he may be in he "
<p>
he palace-he be like a british gentleman become an official far from home
he be like the man robert morgan have describe
he letters dated from the palace of the lieutenant-governor
henry found the palace a low grubby house with wall of whitewash mud and a roof of red tile badly mould
there be a gaudy halberdier standing at the door holding he great ineffectual weapon rigidly before he the while he maintain a torture decorum in the face of a swarm of enemy fly
<p>
the halberd lower across the pathway as henry approach
<p>
"i be look for sir edward morgan "
<p>
"what do he wish with he excellency?"
<p>
"why he see sir he be he uncle and i wish to speak with he "
<p>
the soldier scowl suspiciously and stiffen he hold on the halberd
then henry remember he lesson of the plantation
perhaps this man for all he red coat might be something of a slave
<p>
"get out of he way he damned pup " he cry
"get out of he way or i'll see he hang "
<p>
the man cower and almost drop he weapon
"yes sir
i'll scend he word sir "
he blow a little silver call and when a servant in green lace came to the door he say :
"a young gentleman to see he excellency "
<p>
henry be lead into a little room make dark with thick grey hanging edge with dull gold
there be three dim portrait on the wall in black frame ; two cavaliers in plume bat holding he sword horizontally so he look like stiff slender tails and a pretty lady with powder hair and a silken gown which left he shoulder and half he breast uncovered
<p>
from some place beyond the curtain doorway there came the thin twang of a harp slow strike
the servant take henry letter and left he alone
<p>
and he feel very much alone
he be a house of cold precise hair splitting
one be aware of a polite contempt even in the picture face on the wall
the british arms be embroider on the curtains of the door the lion on one side holding half the shield and the unicorn with he half on the other
when the curtains hang straight the design be complete
in this room henry begin to fear he uncle
<p>
but all these thought of he be shock from he brain when sir edward appear
he be he father as he remember he and yet never he father
old robert would never have have a moustache like an eyelash and nothing in robert's life could have make he pinch he lip together until he be as thin as the moustache
these two might have be born alike as bean but each have create he own mouth
<p>
robert have speak truth ; this man be he strut counterpart
but sir edward be like an actor who though cast in a ridiculous role yet make he part seem the correct thing and all other absurd
he purple coat with lace at the neck and wrist the long rapier lean as a pencil in a scabbard of grey silk the grey silk stocking and soft grey shoe with bow ribbon on them seem to henry the high type of proper wear
he own good clothing be shabby by comparison
<p>
he uncle have be look at he steadily wait for henry to speak first
<p>
"i be henry morgan sir son " he begin simply
<p>
"i see he be
there be a resemblance-a faint likeness
and what may i do for you?"
<p>
"why i-i do know
i came to call on he and inform he of he existence "
<p>
"that be kind of you-ah-very kind "
<p>
he be difficult to broach speech into this field of almost sneering courtesy
henry ask
"have he hear any single thing of he parent in the long five year i have be out?"
<p>
"five year !
what have he be doing pray?"
<p>
"i be a bond-servant sir
but of he parents?"
<p>
"your mother be dead "
<p>
"my mother be dead " henry repeated in a whisper
he wonder if he have die soon after he have go
he do not feel very badly about he and yet the word sound such tremendous thing such final thing
this be the end of something that might never be again
"my mother be dead " he murmur
"and he father?"
<p>
"i have hear that he father do peculiar thing in he rose garden
squire rhys write he of he
he pluck the full flower and cast them into the air like one amaze
the ground be cover with petal and the neighbour stand about and laugh at he
robert be never normal ; indeed he be never quite sane or he might have go far with james i i for one always think he would come to some disgrace or other
he revere nothing worthy of reverence
why musth he do this thing in the open with the people jeering?
he bring ridicule on his-ah-relative "
<p>
"and do he think he be really insane uncle?"
<p>
"i do not know " sir edward say and add with a touch of impatience "i merely quoted squire rhys' letter
he position do not allow he time for vain conjecture-nor much time for idle conversation " he say pointedly
<p>
the methodical twang of the harp have cease and now the curtain of the door be thrust aside and a slender girl enter the room
he be difficult to see he in this dark place
he be plain he be not beautiful but rather proudly pretty
he be softly dress and he face be pale
even he hair be pale fragile gold
altogether he seem a wan tire echo of sir edward
<p>
the girl be startle at seeing henry there and he found that he be a little afraid of he in the same manner that he be grow to fear sir edward
he look at henry as though he be some distasteful food which only the strict rule of courtesy prevent he from pushing away from he place
<p>
"your cousin henry " sir edward say shortly ; and "my motherless daughter elizabeth "
then nervously as though no good could possibly come of this contact "hadn't he good practice he music a little longer he dear?"
<p>
he drop a suggestion of a curtsy to henry and in a voice like he father greet he
<p>
"how d'ye do
yes sir i think i have good practice
that last piece be difficult but beautiful "
and he disappear behind the curtain whence came again the slow accurate striking of the harp
<p>
henry grip he resolve though he be afraid of this man
<p>
"there be a thing i wish to speak of sir
i want to go a uncle-on the sea in a great ship with gun
and when i have take prise and a cloud of man gather to he reputation then i would be capture a spanish town for plunder and ransom
i be a good sailor he uncle
i can navigate in any sea i think ; and i have he in he to plan carefully he campaign
i have read a great lot on the ancient war
the buccaneer have never be the force i mean to make them
why i could forme army and navy of them he dear uncle
in time i would lead the whole free brotherhood of the coast and he would be an armed power to reckon with
<p>
"these thing i have considered in the long year of he slavery
there be a crying in he heart to do these thing
i think the end of all he dream be a great name and a great fortune
i know he power
i be twenty year old ; i have have several year at sea ; and i have a thousand pound
the man who help he now-who go with he as partner-i will make rich
i be so very sure i can do these thing-so very sure
<p>
"i ask he he uncle to add to he thousand pound enough so that i may buy a fitted ship and gather the free brave spirit about he to do he will
if he will place another thousand pound in he hands i swear to make he rich than he be "
<p>
the harp be no longer sounding
at the beginning of the boy outburst sir edward have hold up he hand as though to stop he but the word plunge on
and when the harp have be silence sir edward look uneasily toward the door
now he seem to bring he interest back to henry
<p>
"i have no money to risk in unsure venture " he say sharply
"and i have no more time for talk
the governor be coming to consult with he in a moment
but i would say that he be a wild careless boy who be like to come to hanging of he venture
he father be like he only he be a wildness of the mind
<p>
"and i musth inform he that there be peace between spain and england ; not very good feeling he be true but still peace
if he go maraud he will be he duty to see he punish sorry for he though i may be
the roundheads be no longer in power and those wild thing that cromwell overlook be carefully watch now
remember what i say for i would not like to hang he nephew
now i musth really bid he good day "
<p>
tears of resentment stand in henry eyes
<p>
"thank he for coming to see he " he uncle say
"good-by "
and he go through the curtain doorway
<p>
in the street henry walk moodily along
he saw he cousin a short distance ahead of he a tall negro attendant upon he
he continue slowly that he might leave he behind but the girl lag on he way
<p>
"perhaps he wish to speak with he " henry think and quicken he step to come up with he
he saw incredulously what the darken room have hide
he be only a little girl not more than fourteen at the most
elizabeth look up as he came beside he
<p>
"do he find interesting thing to be doing here in the indies?"
henry ask
<p>
"as many as one might expect " he reply
"we have be here a good while he know "
and touching he slave arm with he little parasol he turn into a crossing street and left young henry look after he
<p>
he be bitter against these proud relative who seem to edge away from he as though he be foul
he could not call them silly for he have impress he too deeply
he have succeed in making he feel alone and helpless and very young
<p>
the narrow way of port royal be deep with muddy filth ground to thick liquid by the cart and the numberless bare foot
port royal bore the same resemblance to a city as the palace of the lieutenant-governor do to whitehall
the street be only narrow alley line with dirty wooden house
and each house have a balcony above the street where people sit and stare at henry as he pass ; stare not with interest but wearily as man in sickness watch fly crawl on the ceiling
<p>
one street seem to have no inhabitant save only woman-black woman and white and grey woman with fever write on he hollow cheek
he lean from he balcony like unclean siren and softly call as he go by
then when he pay no attention to them he shriek like angry parrot and scream curse and spit after he
<p>
near the waterfront he came to a kind of tavern with a great crowd gather in front of he
standing in the center of the way be a cask of wine with he head stave in and a big drunken man in crazy lace and a plume hat strut beside he
he pass out cup and basin and even hat full of wine to the reach man
now and then he call for a toast and a cheer and he crowd scream he acclaim
<p>
young henry seek to pass them in he misery
<p>
"come drink he health young man "
<p>
"i do not wish to drink " say henry
<p>
"you do not wish to drink?"
the big man be overwhelm with this new situation
then he re-cover he wrath
<p>
"by god ! he will so drink when captain dawes that take the supply ship sangre de cristo this day week ask he "
the lower man came close then suddenly draw a great pistol from he belt and pointed he waveringly at henry breast
<p>
the boy eyed the pistol
<p>
"i will drink he health " he say
and while he drink an idea came to he
"let he speak to he alone captain dawes sir " and he tug the pirate into the tavern door
"about he next trip he begin
<p>
"my next trip and hell ! " the captain roar
"i've just take a good prise have i?
i've get money have i?
then what be this he be squall about a next trip?
wait till the prise be spend and the wound heal
wait till i've drain port royal dry of wine and then come talk about the next trip "
he rush back into the street crowd
"boys ! " he yell
"boys he have not drunk he health for hours
come shout together now and then he will sing ! "
<p>
henry walk onward in despair
in the harbour a number of ship be lie at anchor
he approach a sailor sitting in the sand
<p>
"that one fast " he say to open the acquaintance
<p>
"aye good enough "
<p>
"are there any buccaneer of note in this town?"
henry ask
<p>
"none but that dawes and he's only a roaring mouse
he take a little boat loaded with supply for campeche and you'd think he be panama he bring home for the noise he make about he "
<p>
"but be there none others?"
<p>
"well there's one he call grippo but he take no prise unless he go unarmed
afraid of he shadow grippo
yes he's in port with no prise and drink black rummy on tick i guess "
<p>
"which be he ship?"
henry ask
<p>
"why there he be
he call he ganymede
he tell that grippo stole he in saint malo when he crew be drunk
he and nine other tumble the poor stiff wretch overside and make off with the ship for the indies
yes she's a good craft but grippo be no master
a wonder he be that he's not wreck he before now
take mansveldt ; there's a master for he-a real master
but mansveldt be in tortuga "
<p>
"a good swift sailor " henry observe ; "though he could carry more canvas without hurt
how about he guns?"
<p>
"they say she's over armed if anything "
<p>
and on that night henry found the buccaneer drink in a hovel on the beach
the man be nearly black ; two fat wrinkle cut each cheek as though a silken cord be pull tight against the flesh until he disappear
he eyes dart here and there like sentry before a camp of little fear
<p>
"are he one he call grippo?"
henry ask
<p>
"i take no prise " the man cry start back
"i take no prise
he have nothing to fasten on he for "
once in saint malo he have be accost thus and afterward he have whip he on the cross until a hundred sag mouth open on he body and every one laugh blood
grippo have fear all semblance of authority since then
<p>
"who be you?" he ask
<p>
"i think i be going to make he fortune grippo " henry say with assurance
he know how to handle this man for he be a counterpart of the many slave of the plantation-fearful and perhaps greedy
"what would he do with five hundred english pound grippo?"
<p>
the black man lick he lip and glance at the empty cup before he
"what musth i do for this money?" he whisper
<p>
"you will sell he the captaincy of the ganymede "
<p>
now grippo be wary
<p>
"the ganymede be worth much more " he say firmly
"but i do not want to buy the ship-only the captaincy
look grippo !
i'll make this compact with he
i will give he five hundred pound for a half interest in the ganymede and all of he command
then he will put to sea
i think i know how to win plunder if there be no interference in he company
grippo i will give he a writing to this effect
if i fail in one single undertaking in the ganymede then he shall have the whole ship back and he shall keep the five hundred pound "
<p>
grippo still look into he empty cup but suddenly he be fill with excitement
<p>
"give he money " he cry out
"quick ! give he the money "
then !
oloto ! bring white wine-white wine-for the love of christ "
<p>
1 3 chapter iii
there be many glitter reputation along the coast of darien and amongst the green caribbean island when henry morgan came to be a buccaneer
in the wine shop of tortuga be tales of a thousand fortune make and spend of fine ship take and sunk of gold and plate dump on the dock like wood
<p>
the free brotherhood have grown to be a terrible thing since pierre le grand and a little band of hunter slip out of the woods of hispaniola and capture the vice-admiral of the plate fleet from a canoe
france and britain and holland have see in these island a good hermitage for he criminal and for year he have unload worthless human freight on the indies
there be a time in those old nation when any one who could not give a good virtuous account of himself be cram into a ship and send off to be a bond-servant to any man who would pay a small sum for he
and when he time be up these people stole gun and warred on spain
he be not strange for spain be catholic and rich while huguenots and lutherans and church of england man be poor and out at heel
he fight a holy war
spain have lock up the treasure of the world
if poor mine beggar could be reach a coin through the keyhole who be the bad for it?
who minded except spain?
surely england and france and holland take little heed of he
sometimes he provided the pirate with commission against aragon and castile so that he might come on a man who ten year before have be send out in a prison ship carry the style of "captain by the grace of the kingbolt "
<p>
france have the good of he wayward child at heart for he send out twelve hundred woman to tortuga to be the wive of buccaneer
the whole twelve hundred turn to a business more profitable than wifehood immediately he landed but france could not help that
<p>
he have get he name these buccaneer of a time when he be nothing more than cattle-hunter
there be a way of smoke meat by burning small bit of fat and flesh in the fire
this make the meat more savoury than usual
he be call the boucan process and from he the pirate be name
<p>
but after a time these hunter came out of the woods in little careful group ; then band form and then whole fleet of eight or ten vessel
and finally thousand assemble in tortuga and from that spot of safety buzz about the flank of spain
<p>
and spain could not combat them
do he hang ten a hundred join he rank ; so he fortify he town and send he treasure on the sea under the protection of warship fill with soldier
the numberless vessel of the spanish colony be nearly all drive from the sea by the fierce buccaneer
only once a year do the plate fleet sail out for home
<p>
there be fine name amongst the brotherhood and exploit to make henry morgan squirm with jealousy if he have not be so confident of overshadow them all one day
<p>
bartolomeo portugues there be who take a great prise
but before he could get away with he he be capture near campeche
the gibbet be erect on the shore for he hanging
he watch them put he up from he prison aboard ship
and in the night before he execution he stab he guard and swim away support by a keg
before eight days have pass he came again with pirate in a long canoe and stole the same ship away from the harbour of campeche
he lose he of course in a storm off cuba but the storey be nevertheless tell with glee in the tavern
<p>
roche braziliano be a hollander with a chubby face
when he be young he be drive from brazil by the portuguese and from he colony he have take he name
curiously he hold no rancour against portugal
he hatred turn on spain
he be a kindly gentle beloved captain so only there be no spaniards about
he man worship he and drink no other toast but to he name
once when he ship be wreck in castilla de oro he kill most of a troop of spanish horse and used he beast to ride off on
when the man of spain be near he roche be a foam beast
he be tell that once he roast prisoner on green spit over a slow fire
<p>
as the rich shipping be drive from the sea the buccaneer musth be taking village and then even town with fort
lewis scot pillage campeche and left he a black smoke pile
<p>
l'ollonais have come from the sable d'ollone and very rapidly he become the most fear man in the western ocean
he begin with a real hatred for spain and end with a strong love of cruelty
he have pull out tongues and carve he prisoner to piece with he sword
the spanish man would far rather have meet the devil in any forme than l'ollonais
the whisper of he name empty the village in he path of every living unit
he be say that the mouse flee to the jungle when he came
maracaibo he take and new gibraltar and st james de leon
everywhere he slaughter man for the fierce love of he
<p>
once when the blood lust be in he he have command that eighty-seven prisoner be bound and lay in a row on the ground
then he walk down the line carry a whetstone in one hand and a long sword in the other
that day he cut off eighty-seven heads with he own hand
<p>
but l'ollonais be not content with murder the spanish man
he go into the gentle country of yucatan where the people live in ruin stone city and where the virgin go crown with flower
he be a quiet people in yucatan and he race be dye in an inexplicable decay
when l'ollonais go away the city be heap of stone and ashes and there be no crown any more
<p>
the indians of darien be different ; fierce and fearless and unrelenting
the spaniards call them bravo and swear that he be untamable
he have be friend of the pirate because he so hate spain but l'ollonais rob them and murder the tribesman
these indians wait many year for he vengeance and at last he catch l'ollonais when he ship have wreck on the shore of he country
he build a fire and dance for hours and then he burned the frenchman's body bit by bit before he eyes a finger and a pinch of flesh at a time
<p>
a lean french gentleman came into a tavern at tortuga one night and when he ask he name seize a large rummy keg and hurl he from he
<p>
"bras de fer " he say and no one ever question he farther
he be never known whether he name be hide for a shame or a sorrow or a hatred but all the coast came to know of he as a great brave captain
<p>
these be man who make phrase to be repeated
<p>
"no prey no pay " the exterminator have bawl and now every one be saying he
when captain lawrence in a small boat be assail by two spanish frigate he say to he man "you have too much experience not to be sensible of he danger and too much courage to fear he "
this be a fine saying and on the strength of he he follower capture the two spanish ship and take them home to goaves
<p>
not all be cruel or even violent man
some have a curious streak of piety
there be captain watling who make he a point to hold divine service every sabbath with the whole crew standing uncovered
daniel once shot a sailor for an irreverence
these buccaneer pray loudly before battle and if he be successful half of them troop off to a capture cathedral to sing the te deum while the other half plunder the prise
<p>
captain of ship maintain the strict discipline amongst he man swiftly punish insubordination or any other wrong-doing which might interfere with he success
there be no such riot at sea as be later tolerate by kidd and blackbeard and lafitte
<p>
but out of the whole history of the brotherhood one man towered
there be a dutchman name edward mansveldt
in bravery and in soldiery he be pre-eminent for he have take granada and st augustine in florida and st catherine's isle
with a great fleet of ship he have go cruise along the coast of darien and castilla de oro taking what he might lay he hands on
but there be a power of dream in he
out of he mob of ragamuffin hero he want to make a strong durable nation a new aggressive nation in america
as more and more of the buccaneer flock to he command he dream solidify
he consult the government of england and france
he be shock and forbid he to consider such a thing
a race of pirate not amenable to the gibbet of the crowns?
why he would be plunder everybody
he musth not be thinking about he at all
<p>
but still he go on plan and plan he new government
he would be start at st catherine's isle
he settle a body of he man there and then go casting about for more to join he new nation
he ship be wreck near the city of havana and spaniards strangle edward mansveldt on the garotte
<p>
these be the man henry morgan have set about to lead
and confidently he saw no barrier so only a man plan carefully and considered he chance
these storey and these man be well enough but he fell short in the large action
he be improvident and vain
he might help he one day
<p>
mansveldt be living and bra de fer be an old man when henry morgan go sailing with black grippo in the ganymede
<p>
1 3 1 i
there be excitement and curiosity in port royal when morgan be fitting out the ganymede for sea
strange stores and unusual weapon be going into he hold
drawn on by the quiet confidence of this young man many sailor volunteer for he crew
the captain found five gunner of reputation in the port and sign them to go with he
when the ganymede drop he sail and slip from the harbour a crowd of idler stand on the beach and watch he go
<p>
he cruised to the coast of darien look for prey but the sea appear to be sweep clean of spanish craft
one morning near the port of cartagena he sighted the tall red hull of a trade ship
captain morgan hide he man
no soul be allow to show himself
even the steersman worked in a tiny house while a dummy wheel swing idly on the deck
then down on the spanish boat he bore and the spanish crew be overwhelm
here came a boat and no man working he
he smack of witchcraft or of one of those nameless tragedy of the sea the sailor talk about
perhaps a plague have kill all the crew and he could take and sell this ship
but when he be close three masked gun spout flame ; he fire only at one spot and when he have done the rudder of the spanish ship hang in splinter and he flounder about in no control
then captain morgan hanging aft out of range of he broadside pour shot into he hull until the flag flutter down
he be the first prise of he plan
<p>
a few days later he bring up with another ship and run alongside to board
the spanish crew be mass against the bulwark to repel the attack
and immediately the air be fill with clay powder pot which landed in the thick group and explode
the spanish man run scream to the shelter of the hold to escape this flashing death
<p>
when henry morgan came at last to tortuga four prise follow in he wake and he have not lose a man
he be as easy as he have known he would be
here be four monument to he plan
one have only to do the unexpected thing quickly
this be the secret of successful war
<p>
mansveldt be in tortuga when henry morgan came and he little eyes glitter as he look at this plunder
soon he send for this new leader
<p>
"you be captain morgan who take the four prise in the harbor?"
<p>
"yes sir i be "
<p>
"and how do he do this thing?
the spanish ship be strongly armed and wary "
<p>
"i do he sir with he plan
many nights have i considered how to do these thing
i work with surprise sir when other man use only force "
<p>
mansveldt regard he with admiration
<p>
"i be fitting out an expedition to take st catherine's isle " he say
"then i be going to forme a republic of buccaneer who will fight with a patriotism
would he like to be vice-admiral of this expedition?
i have some reputation for pick man "
<p>
the name of mansveldt be mighty on the sea and henry flush with pleasure
<p>
"i would like he sir " he say quickly
<p>
the fleet sail out and captain morgan be vice-admiral
there be a fine assault ; the ship throw in he ragged horde and slaughter walk on the wall
the island could not withstand the fierceness of the attack and finally the fortress fell
then the dutch admiral draw up he government and left henry morgan in command while he go out to scour the world for recruit
he and he ship be lose and never hear from again
he be say the spaniards strangle he in cuba
<p>
captain morgan be now the paramount leader of the spanish main
ship fly from the way to join he fleet to sail under he command and fight with he and share in he success
he go up against puerto bello and sack the town
the house be burned and all the helpless citizen be plunder
when captain morgan's ship sail off the jungle be already creep into the ruin
<p>
for ten year he sail about the ocean amongst the island and along the green coast of tropic america and he be the greatest name of all who have go out for plunder
the pirate of the world came flock to he reputation
people cheer he in tortuga and goaves
numberless man volunteer for every expedition
now all the brotherhood wait for captain morgan to open a keg of liquor in the street or to run wild through the town
he never do
coldly he walk about clad in a purple coat and grey silk stocking and grey shoe with bow
at he side hang a long rapier no thick than a pencil in a scabbard of grey silk
<p>
at first the sailor strive to establish a comradeship with he but he prick them away with frigid insult
the lesson of the slave live on in he
he do not try to buy he popularity and all the free brotherhood shower he upon he-cast he live and he fortune on the knee of he success
<p>
1 3 2 ii
ten year of fight and plunder and burning and he be thirty
he grey hair seem to coil more closely to he head
henry morgan be successful the most luck-follow freebooter the world have known and the man of he profession give he that admiration he have crave
he enemy and any man of spain who have money be he enemy-shudder at the mention of he name
he have place he in he fear beside drake and l'ollonais
<p>
he have go out with grippo in the ganymede assured that when he gun roar into a spanish hull when he stand embattled on a spanish deck with cry and clash of iron weapon about he there would come that flaming happiness he heart desire
these thing he have experienced and there be not even content
the nameless crave in he grow and flex he claw against he heart
he have think the adulation of the brotherhood might salve the wind of he desire ; that when the pirate saw the result of he plan and marvel at them he would be please and flatter
and this thing happen
the man fairly fawn on he and he found that he despise them for he and considered them fool to be take with such simple thing
<p>
henry have grown lonely in he glory
old merlin have speak truth so long ago for captain morgan have come to he success and he be alone in he success with no friend anywhere
the crave of he heart musth lie crouch within he
all he fear and sorrow and conceit he failure and little weakness musth be conceal
these he follower have gather to the cry of he success ; he would leave he at the first small sign of weakness
<p>
while he be engaged in winning plunder a little rumour have come stealthily across the isthmus have float amongst the island and steal aboard the ship
man catch the whisper name and listen carefully
<p>
"there be a woman in panama and he be lovely as the sun
he call he the red saint in panama
all man kneel to he "
thus say the whisper
the voice grow and grow until man in the tavern drink to la santa roja
young seaman whisper of he in the dog watch
"there be a woman in the cup of gold and all man fall before he as heathen kneel before the sun "
he spoke softly of he in the street of goaves
no one have see he ; no one could tell the tint of he cheek or the colour of he hair
yet in a few year every man in the wide wild main have drunk to the red saint have dream of he ; many have pray to la santa roja
he become to every man the quest of he heart bearing the image of some fair young girl left on a european beach to be gloriously colored by the year
and panama be to every man the nest of he desire
he be a curious thing
in time no speech amongst gather man could end without mention of la santa roja
he be become a queer delirium in the mind of the rough pirate a new virgin for he worship
many say he be mary come to live on earth again and he add he name in he prayer
<p>
now when captain morgan have take puerto bello the governor of panama be fill with admiration and wonder that such a ragged band of ill-order man and without uniform could capture such a city
he send a messenger ask for a small sample of the weapon which have make this thing possible
captain morgan take the runner to a small room that have escape the general fire
<p>
"have he see the woman who he call the red saint in panama?" he ask
<p>
"i have not see he no ; but i have hear of he
the young man put only the blessed virgin before he in he worship
he be say that he be lovely as the sun "
<p>
"what be he name besides la santa roja?"
<p>
"i do not know
i have only hear that he be lovely as the sun
he tell in panama that he came from cordova and have be to paris
he be say he family be noble
he tell how he ride great horse sitting astride in a meadow guarded with a thick hedge
he be say that in he hand a rapier be a living thing and that he can fence more skilfully than any man
these thing he do in secret that no one may see the crime against he modesty "
<p>
"ah well ! " say captain morgan "if he be beautiful enough what need have he of modesty
this modesty be only a kind of beauty patch which be put on when there be visitor-an enthrall gesture
i should like to see he ride
and do he know nothing more of her?"
<p>
"only what he say in the tavern sir-that he have steal worship from the blessed saint "
<p>
captain morgan dream long in he chair while the runner wait silently
at last henry shake he head as though to disengage he of cloy thought
he draw a pistol from he belt and give he to the messenger
<p>
"take this to don juan perez de guzman and say that this be a sample of the weapon he have used in lay puerto bello in the dust
but he other weapon be the strong hearts of he follower
i will not scend he one of these but i will bring he a great number
and tell he to keep the pistol for a year when i himself will come to panama to receive he from he own hands
do he understand?"
<p>
"i do sir "
<p>
and in a few days the runner came again bring the pistol back and a large square emerald set in a ring
<p>
"my master beg that he accept this stone as a token of he regard
he beg that he do not give himself the trouble to come to panama for then he duty would overwhelm he admiration and force he to hang he to a tree "
<p>
"it be a good message " say the captain ; "a good brave message
i should like to meet with don juan if only at sword point
he have be long since any one defy he
and do he learn more of la santa roja?"
<p>
"only what he tell in the street sir
i inquired closely for he benefit
i be tell that in the street he wear a thick veil that none may see he face
some think he do this so that the poor man who meet he will not kill himself for love
that be all i could learn
have he further message sir?"
<p>
"only repeat that i will go to the cup of gold within the year "
<p>
1 3 3 iii
through all he life he will have be like an iron weathervane steadfastly pointing always but never long in one direction
the indies and the sea and pillage and glory all seem to have fail he
he have touched all thing and watch them pale and shrivel at he touch
and he be lonely
he man regard he with respect and sullen awe
he be afraid of he and this state do not feed he vanity as once he have
<p>
he wonder if he might not make a friend amongst he follower but the time he have dwell alone in the castle of himself have be so long that this think fill he with a curious boyish embarrassment
who amongst he follower might be he friend?
he considered them remember he sullen scowl he gleam avaricious eyes at the division of spoil
he feel nothing but contempt for them
<p>
but there be one who he have notice a young frenchman who be call coeur de gris
captain morgan have see he in action leap about the deck like a supple animal while he rapier flick out in lithe tongues of silver fire
he scorn a cutlass for the long thin blade
<p>
and this young man answer he order with a smile at captain morgan
there be respect in he eyes surely but no fear no jealousy and no suspicion
<p>
"i wonder if this coeur de gris would be he friend " muse henry morgan
"it be say that he have left a trail of break hearts from cuba to saint kit and somehow for this i fear he a little "
<p>
captain morgan send for the young man and when he be come found difficulty in speaking to he
<p>
"ah-how be he coeur de gris?"
<p>
the young man be overwhelm by any show of warmth from this captain
<p>
"why sir i be very well
have he order for me?"
<p>
"orders?
no ; i-i think i would like to talk with he-that be all "
<p>
"to talk with he sir?
but to talk of what?"
<p>
"well-how be the many little love he be reputed to have?" the captain ask in an uneasy effort at joviality
<p>
"repute be kind to he than nature sir "
<p>
henry morgan plunge to he purpose
<p>
"listen to he coeur de gris !
can he not imagine that i may need a friend?
can he not think of he as a lonely man?
consider how all he follower be afraid of he
he come for order but never to pass a quiet time of day
i know i make this so
he be necessary once for i have to build up respect before i could command obedience
but now there be time when i should like to be telling he thought and talk of something besides war and spoil
for ten year i have ravage the sea like a silent wolf and i have no friend anywhere
<p>
"i have choose he to be he friend ; first because i like he and second because he have not a thing on earth he might be thinking i want to steal
thus he may like he without fear
he be a strange thing how he man suspect he
i have give a strict accounting for every voyage yet if i spoke to them as friend he would beat he brain to discover he plot
and will he be he friend coeur de gris?"
<p>
"'why certainly i will he captain and have i known of such a thing in he mind i would have be for long
how may i serve he sir?"
<p>
"oh just by talk with he now and then and by trustful he a little
i have no motive save he loneliness
but he speak and act like a gentleman coeur de gris
may i ask of he family? or do he draw this name about he like a cape as so many do here on the main?"
<p>
"it be very simple to tell he of he family
he be say that he father be the great bra de fer and who he be no one ever know
the people give he he name remember he
he mother be one of the free woman of goaves
he be sixteen when i be born
he be a very ancient family but huguenot in worship
he holding be destroy in the murder of st bartholomew
thus he came about that he be penniless when he mother be born
and he be pick up by the watch in paris street one day and send to goaves with a shipload of woman vagrant
bra de fer found he soon afterward "
<p>
"but he say he be a free woman " say henry morgan scandalize at this young man apparent lack of shame
"surely he have give up this-this practice now he be successful on the sea
he be taking home enough for both of he and more "
<p>
"i know i be but he continue
i do not mention he for why should i interfere with what he consider a serious work
he be proud of he position proud that he caller be the good people in the port
and he please he that although he be nearly forty he can more than compete with the young unseasoned squab who come in every year
why should i change the gentle course of he way even if i could?
no he be a dear lovely woman and he have be a good mother to he
he only fault be that he be fill with over-many little scruple
he nag at he when i be at home and cry so when i leave
he be dreadfully afraid that i may find some woman who may do he harm "
<p>
"that be strange be he not?-considering he life " say henry morgan
<p>
"why be he strange?
musth he have a different brain in that ancient profession?
no sir ; i assure he that he life be immaculate-prayer thrice a day and there be no fine house in all goaves than he
why sir when last i go there i take with he a scarf which fell to he lot in the division a glorious thing of gossamer and gold
he would not have he
he belong about the neck of some woman who put he faith in the romish church he say and he would not be decent for a good huguenot to wear he
ah ! he worry so about he when i be off to sea
he be terribly afraid i may be hurt but far more afraid of the taint of he soul
such be all he knowledge of he family sir "
<p>
captain morgan have step to a cupboard and bring out some queer little jug with wine of peru
there be two neck on each jug and when the wine be pour out from one a sweet whistling sound came from the other
<p>
"i take these from a spanish ship " he say
"will he drink with he coeur de gris?"
<p>
"i should be very much honor sir "
<p>
he sit a long time sip the wine then captain morgan spoke dreamily
<p>
"i suppose coeur de gris that he will one day be strike with the red saint and then he shall have the bee of panama buzz out upon he
i have no doubt he be as jealously guarded as be helen
he have hear of the red saint have he not?"
<p>
the young man eyes be glow with the wine
<p>
"heard of he ! " he say softly
"sir i have dream of he and call to he in he sleep
who have not?
who in all this quarter of the world have not hear of he and yet who know any single thing about her?
he be a strange thing the magic of this woman name
la santa roja !
la santa roja !
he conjure up desire in the heart of every man-not active possible desire but the 'if i be handsome if i be a prince kind of desire
the young man make wild plan ; some to go disguised to panama other to blow he up with quantity of powder
he day-dream of carry the red saint off with them
sir i have hear a seaman all rotten with disease whisper to himself in the night 'if this thing be not on he i would go adventure for la santa roja '
<p>
"my mother fret and fret there in goaves lest i go mad and run to he
he be terrify by this strange woman
'go not near to he he son ' he say
'this woman be wicked ; he be a devil ; besides he be without doubt a catholic '
and no one have ever see he that he know of
he do not know certainly that there exist such a woman as the red saint in the cup of gold
ah ! he have spread the sea with dream-with longing dream
i have be thinking sir that perhaps sometime the cup of gold may go the way of troy town on account of he "
<p>
henry morgan have fill the glasses again and again
he be slump forward in he chair and a little crooked smile be on he mouth
<p>
"yes " he say rather thickly "she be a danger to the peace of nation and to the peace of man mind
the matter be wholly ridiculous of course
he be probably a shrewish bitch who take he bright feature from the legend
but how might such a legend be started?
he health coeur de gris
he will be a good friend to he and true?"
<p>
"i will he captain "
<p>
and again he sit silently drink the rich wine
<p>
"but there be much suffering bound up in woman " henry morgan begin as though he have just finished speaking
"they seem to carry pain about with them in a leak package
he have love often he say coeur de gris
have he not feel the pain he carry?"
<p>
"no sir i do not think i have
surely i have be assail by regret and little sorrow-everyone have ; but mostly i have found only pleasure amongst woman "
<p>
"ah he be lucky " the captain say
"you be fill with luck not to have known the pain
he own life be poison by love
this life i lead be forced on he by lose love "
<p>
"why how be that sir?
surely i have not think that he
"i know ; i know how i musth have change so that even he laugh a little at the think of he be in love
i could not now command the affection of the daughter of an earl "
<p>
"the daughter of an earl sir?"
<p>
"yes an earl daughter
he love too perfectly-too passionately
once he came to he in a rose garden and lay in he arms until the dark be go
i think to run away with he to some new lovely country and sink he title in the sea behind he
perhaps even now i might be living safe in virginia with little joy crowd he footstool "
<p>
"it be a great pity sir "
coeur de gris be truly sorry for this man
<p>
"ah well ; he father be informed
on one dark night he arms be pin to he side and he-oh dear elizabeth ! -was tear away from he
he place he still bound in a ship and sell he in barbados
can he not see coeur de gris the bitterness that lie restlessly in he heart?
during these year he face have follow he in all he wandering
somehow i feel that i might have make some later move-but he father be a powerful lord "
<p>
"and do he never go back for he after he imprisonment be done?"
<p>
henry morgan look down at the floor
<p>
"no he friend-i never do "
<p>
1 3 4 iv
the legend of the red saint grow in he brain like a powerful vine and a voice came out of the west to coax and mock to jeer and cozen henry morgan
he forget the sea and he idle ship
the buccaneer be penniless from he long inactivity
he lay about the deck and cursed he captain for a dream fool
he struggle madly against the fold mesh of he dream and argue with the voice
<p>
"may god damn la santa roja for sow the world with an insanity
he have make cut-throat bay the moon like lovesick dog
he be making he crazy with this vain desire
i musth do something-anything-to lay the insistent haunting of this woman i have never see
i musth destroy the ghost
ah he be a foolish thing to dream of capture the cup of gold
he would seem that he desire be death "
<p>
and he remember the hunger which have drawn he from cambria for he be duplicate and strengthen now
he thought be driving sleep away
when drowsiness creep in on the heel of exhaustion la santa roja came in too
<p>
"i will take maracaibo " he cry in desperation
"i will drown this lust in a bowl of horror
i will pillage maracaibo tear he to piece and leave he bleed in the sand
<p>
 ( there be a woman in the cup of gold and he worship he for unnamable beauty ) 
<p>
"make the gathering at the isle de la vaca !
call in true hearts from the corner of the sea !
he go to riches ! "
<p>
he ship fly out to the bay of maracaibo and the town be frantic in defence
<p>
"run into this bottle harbour !
yes under the gun ! "
<p>
cannon balls cry through the air and strike up cloud of dirt from the wall but the defence hold ground
<p>
"it will not fall?
then take he in assault ! "
<p>
powder pot fly over the wall tearing and maim the defender in he burst
<p>
"who be these wolves?" he cry
"ah brother ! he musth fight until he die !
he musth ask no clemency brother
if he fall he dear city
ladder rose against the fort and a wave of roaring man swarm over the wall
<p>
"ah san lorenzo ! hide he ! bear he away !
these be no man but devil
hear he !
hear he !
quarter !
ah jesus ! where art thou now?"
<p>
"throw down the wall !
let no two stone stand together ! "
<p>
 ( there be a woman in the cup of gold and he be lovely as the sun ) 
<p>
"grant no quarter !
kill the spanish rat !
kill all of them ! "
<p>
and maracaibo lay pleading at he foot
door be tear from the house and the room gut of every movable thing
he herd the woman to a church and lock them in
then the prisoner be bring to henry morgan
<p>
"here be an old man sir
he be sure he have riches but he have hide them away and he can never find any "
<p>
"then put he foot in the fire ! -why he be a brazen fool !
break he arms !
- he will not tell?
put the whip-cord about he temple !
-oh kill he ! kill he and stop he scream-perhaps he have no money
 ( there be a woman in panama ) 
"have he scratch out every grain of gold?
place the city at ransom !
he musth have riches after pain "
<p>
a fleet of spanish ship came sailing to the rescue
<p>
"a spanish squadron coming?
he will fight them !
no no ; he shall run from them if he can get away
he hull lag in the water with he weight of gold
kill the prisoner ! "
<p>
 ( -she be lovely as the sun ) 
<p>
and captain morgan sail from break maracaibo
two hundred and fifty thousand piece of eight be in he ship and roll of silken stuff and plate of silver and sack of spice
there be golden image from the cathedral and vestment crust with embroidery of pearl
and the city be a fire-sweep wreck
<p>
"we be rich than he could have hope
there will be joy in tortuga when he come
every man a hero !
he shall have a mad riot of a time "
<p>
 ( la santa roja be in panama ) 
<p>
"ah god ! then if i musth i musth
but i fear i go to he death
he be a dreadful thing to be attempt
if this be he desire i musth though i die "
he call young coeur de gris to he
<p>
"you have distinguished himself in this fight he friend "
<p>
"i have done what be necessary sir "
<p>
"but he fight finely
i saw he when he engaged
now i have make he he lieutenant in the field he second in command
he be brave he be sagacious and he be he friend
i can trust he and who amongst he man will bear this trust if he be worth he while to fail?"
<p>
"it be a great honour sir
i will pay he surely with he fidelity
he mother will be very please "
<p>
"yes " say captain morgan ; "you be a young fool and that be a virtue in this business as long as one have a leader
now the man be straining to get back that he may spend he money
if he be possible he would be pushing the ship to hurry them
what will he do with he money coeur de gris?"
<p>
"why i shall scend half to he mother
the remain sum i shall divide in two
part i shall put away and on the other i expect to be drunk for a few days or perhaps a week
he be good to be drunk after fight "
<p>
"drunkenness have never be a pleasure to he " the captain say
"it make he very sad
but i have a new venture turning in he brain
coeur de gris what be the rich city of the western world?
what place have be immune from the slight gesture of the brotherhood?
where might he all make millions?"
<p>
"but sir he do not think-surely he can consider he possible to take "
"i will take panama-even the cup of gold "
<p>
"how may he do this thing?
the city be strongly guarded with wall and troop and the way across the isthmus be nigh impassable but for the burro trail
how will he do this thing?"
<p>
"i musth take panama
i musth capture the cup of gold "
the captain jaw set fiercely
<p>
now coeur de gris be smile quietly
<p>
"why do he grin at me?" demand captain morgan
"i be thinking of a chance remarque i make a little time ago that panama be like to go the way of troy town "
<p>
"ah ! this nameless woman be in he mind
dismiss he !
he may be there exist no such woman "
<p>
"but then sir he be rich enough of this last spoil "
<p>
"it would be no evil thing to grow rich
i be tire of plunder
i would rest securely "
<p>
coeur de gris hesitate a time while he eyes be cover with a soft veil
<p>
"i be thinking sir that when he come to panama every man will be at he friend throat over the red saint "
<p>
"oh he may trust he to keep order amongst he man strict order-though i hang half of them to do he
a while ago i send word to panama that i would go there but i do he as a joke
and i wonder now whether he have be fortify himself
perhaps he too think he a joke
go now coeur de gris and speak to no man of this
i make he he ambassador
let the man throw he gold away
encourage gambling-here-now-on the ship
give them an example at the tavern-an expensive example
then he will be drive to go out with he
i musth have an army this time he friend and even then he may all die
perhaps that be the chief joy of life-to risk he
do he work well coeur de gris and he may be one day he will be rich than he can think "
<p>
young coeur de gris stand muse by the mast
<p>
"our captain he cold captain have be bite by this great nebulous rumour
how strange this pattern be !
he be as though the red saint have be steal from he arms
he dream be violate
i wonder when he know if every man will carry this feeling of a bitter loss-will hate the captain for steal he desire "
<p>
1 3 5 v
sir edward morgan lead force against st eustatius and while the battle rage a slim brown indian slip up and drive a long knife into he stomach
the lieutenant-governor set he lip in a straight hard line and crumple to the ground
<p>
"my white breeches will be ruin " he think

"yes quite badly

<p>
"nonsense papa ; he be only joke to excite he "

"whether i can or not i shall die presently
now let he discuss this matter while he can
perhaps he cousin who have come to such fame through robbery will care for he elizabeth
i be pained at the think but-but he be necessary to live-very necessary
and after all he be he cousin "
<p>
"i will not believe he
i simply will not believe he
he can die ! "
<p>
"you musth stay with the governor until he can meet he cousin
tell he the exact standing of the matter ; no fawn-but do not be too proud
remember he be he own blood cousin even though he be a robber "
he heavy breathing fill the room
elizabeth have begin to cry softly like a child who can quite tell whether or not he be hurt
finally word be forced from sir edward's lip
<p>
"i have hear that he can tell a gentleman by the way he die-but i should like to groan
robert would have groan if he have wish
of course robert be queer-but then-he be he own brother-he would have shriek if he have feel like he
elizabeth will you-please-leave the room
i be sorry but i musth groan
never speak of it-elizabeth-he promise-never-never to speak of it?"
<p>
and when he came again sir edward morgan be dead
<p>
1 3 6 vi
spring have come to cambria well up out of the indies and out of the hot dry heart of africa and this the fifteenth spring since henry go away
old robert like to think and then came curiously to believe that he son send the spring to cambria out of the tropic place
there be a green fur climbing up the hill and the tree be test new fragile leave in the wind
<p>
old robert's face have grown more set
around he mouth live less a smile and more a grimace as though some ancient anguish smile have freeze there
ah ! the year have be lonely barren thing with nothing left in he arms for he
he know the meaning now of gwenliana's word-that age bring nothing with he save a cold restless wait ; a dull expectancy of a state that might not be imagine with any assurance
perhaps he wait for the time when henry would come to he again
but that could scarcely be so
he be not at all sure that he want to see henry any more
he would be disturb
when one be old one hate disturb thing
<p>
for a long time he have wonder "what be henry doing now? what seeing now?"
and then the boy have fade slightly have come to be like people in old book-not quite real yet real enough to be remember
but robert think often of this abstract person he son of who he hear waver rumour now and again
<p>
with wake on the fine morning of the spring robert have say "i will climb up to see merlin today
strange how that old man live under the grow pressure of he year
there musth be more than a hundred of them now
he body be a thin wisp-nothing more than a suggestion that here be once a body
but william say if he can be pick think out of william's speaking that he voice be golden and strong as always and that he still talk tremendous nonsense that would not be tolerate at london
he be amazing how this road-mender have he whole life curl like a kitten around four days in london
but i musth be going to merlin
he be not likely that i shall go again "
<p>
the steep rocky path be a thing of torture to he ; more a cruel thing because of he memory of lithe powerful leg and lung as tireless as bellows
once he have lead all comer in the mountain race but now he climb a bit then rest on a stone and climb again-up and up into the cleft and over the rock shoulder
he be noon when he came at last to crag top
<p>
merlin meet he at the door before he have time to knock and merlin have no more change than the harp and spear-head hanging to he wall
he seem to have discard time like a garment
merlin came to robert with no surprise
he be as though he have known of this slow pilgrimage a thousand year before the day have happen
<p>
"it be very long robert since he climb the path to he and long since i go down he "
and "down down" sing the harp
he spoke the language of the string and he respond like a distant choir in high mass of the mountain
<p>
"but it's an old man who climb to he now merlin
the trail be a beast enemy to wrestle with
he seem no old
i wonder when he will come to die
do not he year sometimes argue that question with you?"
<p>
"why to speak truthfully robert i have take he in he mind several time but always there be too many thing to think about
i could not take the time to die
if i do i might not be able to think ever again
<p>
"for up here robert that furtive hope the valley man call faith become a questionable thing
oh without doubt if there be a great many about he and he all intone endlessly the chant 'there be a wise kind god ; surely he shall go on living after death ' then i might be prepare for the coming life
but here alone half-way up the sky i be afraid that death would interrupt he muse
the mountain be a kind of poultice for a man abstract pain
amongst them he laugh-oh far more often than he cry "
<p>
"you know " say robert "my mother the old gwenliana make a last curious prophecy before he die
'this night the world end ' he say 'and there will be no more earth to walk upon '
"
"robert i think he spoke truth
i think he dye word be truth whatever may have be he other augury
this gnawing think come visit sometimes and because of he i be afraid to die-horribly afraid
if by he living i give life to he and fresh existence to the field and tree and all the long green world he would be an unutterable deed to wipe them all out like a chalk drawing
i musth not-yet awhile
<p>
"but enough of these foreboding thing
there be no laughter in them
he robert have be too long in the valley of man
he lip laugh but there be no amusement in he heart
i think he place he lip so like twig over a traprock to conceal he pain from god
once he try to laugh with all he soul but he do not make the satirist concession-that of buy with a little amusement at himself the privilege of laugh a great deal at other "
<p>
"i know that i be defeat merlin and there seem to be no help for he
victory or luck or whatever he wish to call he appear to lie hide in a choose few as baby tooth hide under the gum
of late year this god have a hard calculating game with he
there have be moment when i think he cheat "
<p>
merlin spoke slowly :
"once i play against a dear young god with goat foot and that game be the reason for he coming here
but then i make the great concession and sign with sad laughter
robert do i not hear a long time past that he be roving in he mind?
surely william stopped by and tell he he have grown insane
do he not do reprehensible thing in he rose garden?"
<p>
robert smile bitterly
"that be one of this god trick " he say
"i will tell he how he be
one day when i be pull the dead leave from he rose he came upon he to make a symbol
this be no unusual thing
how often do man stand on hill tops with he arms outstretch how often kneel in prayer and cross himself
i pull a bloom and throw he into the air and the petal shower down about he
he seem that this act gather up and tell the whole storey of he life in a gesture
then the loveliness of white petal on black earth absorbed he and i forget he symbol
i throw another and another until the ground be snow with rose leave
suddenly i look up and saw a dozen man standing about laugh at he
he have come by from church
'hee ! ' he say 'robert have lose he mind
hee ! he sense be slip out of he
ho ! he be a child again throw rose petal '
he seem a crazed god who could allow this thing "
<p>
merlin be shake with a silent glee
<p>
"oh robert !
robert ! why musth he blame the world when he protect himself against you?
i think god and the world be one to he
if there be ten people in the valley below who like the look of rose leave on the ground he would only be a very queer person interesting and something of a curiosity
he would bring stranger to he house on sunday afternoons and exhibit he
but since there be none of course he be a radical who musth be lock up or hang
judgment of insanity be truly the hanging of a man mind if he be whisper of he that he brain wander then nothing he can say will matter to any one ever again except as a thing to laugh at
<p>
"can he not see robert?
people have so often be hurt and trap and torture by idea and contraption which he do not understand that he have come to believe all thing passing he understanding be vicious and evil-thing to be stamp out and destroy by the first corner
he only protect himself thus against the ghastly hurt that can come to them from little thing grown up "
<p>
"i know " say robert ; "i know all that and i do not cry out against he
he great complaint be that the only possession i carry about with he be a bag of loss
i be the owner solely of the memory of thing i used to have
perhaps he be well-for i seem to love them more now that i have them not
but i can understand how this fortune may be born hide in a choose few
he own son assault and keep each one of he desire if the wind tell truth "
<p>
"you have a son robert ; i remember now
i think i prophesy that he would rule some world or other if he do not grow up "
<p>
"and so he do
news of he come out of the south on a light inaccurate wind
rumour have wing like bat
he be say that he rule a wild race of pirate ; that he have capture town and pillage city
the english be elate and call he a hero and a patriotic man-and so do i sometimes
but i fear if i be a spaniard he would be only a successful robber
i have hear-though i do not believe he ; i do not want to believe he-that he have torture prisoner "
<p>
"so " merlin muse "he have come to be the great man he think he want to be
if this be true then he be not a man
he be still a little boy and want the moon
i suppose he be rather unhappy about he
those who say child be happy forget he childhood
i wonder how long he can stave off manhood
<p>
"robert have he see those great black ant which be born with wings?
he fly a day or two then drop he wing and fall upon the ground to crawl for all he live
<p>
i wonder when he son will drop he wing
be he not strange robert how amongst man this crawl be revere-how child tear at he wing so he may indulge in this magnificent crawling?"
<p>
"what make boy grow to men?"
robert ask
"what circumstance rot out he wing roots?"
<p>
"why a great many never have wing and some tear them off for himself ; some be sudden thing and other very tedious
i do not know them all but mine be ridicule-a kind of self-ridicule
i love a small girl in the valley and i suppose he be beautiful
i hope i be handsome
i make a song for he and call he the bride of orpheus
i rather fancied himself orpheus then
but he considered marriage with a deity as some manner of a crime against nature
he lecture he
every man so he say owe he to something or other-he family or he community or himself i forget just what-to make a success of himself
he be vague as to the nature of success but he make he very plain that song be not a structure of success
and deity he abhor especially pagan deity
there be a man with lands and house who be reassuringly human
even in he old age i think spitefully that he be deplorably human
so he be married and ridicule gnaw off he wing
<p>
"i parade murder and suicide and field of glory through he mind to fight this little pain ridicule
in he shame i think to lock up he song from the world so that never again might people hear them
the world do not even know when i be go
no little group of people came to plead with he to return-and i have promise the ridicule he would
he bite wing drop ; i be a man and do not want the moon
and when i try to sing again he voice have grown husky like a drover voice and he song be thick with forethought and plannings "
<p>
"i wonder how i grow " robert say
"i do not remember
perhaps he youth go out of he stick to coin-or perhaps he live in those lands i used to dream of
but be swim in he dream and sometimes i be very jealous of he
<p>
"do he know merlin there be a thing which have appear strange to he
he mother gwenliana think he have the second sight and he humour he because he take such joy of he
and on the night that henry go away he cast a picture of he life
merlin nearly all he word have come to be the truth
can these thought have come on he like a series of bright paintings?
he be a strange unlikely thing "
<p>
"perhaps he read he desire robert and sense the strength of he desire
i teach old gwenliana many thing which have to do with magic ; he be very apt at reading sign-and face "
<p>
old robert rose to stretch himself
"ah well-i musth be going now
he take a weary time for such an aged man to be get down the path
he will be night when i be home again
here be william coming with he pick which be an appendage born to he
i will be going down a bit in he company and learning the way of thing at london
he musth love word merlin to be making so many of them ; and i musth love pain to be engender he against himself
<p>
"and merlin i think he be a trickster and a fraud ; every time i have go away from he he have be with the conviction that he have say mighty thing yet on thinking i could never recall any of them
i think he work a subtle conjuring with the soft voice of he and he harp "
<p>
and as he go down the path the hanging harp croon after he the sorcerer farewell
<p>
1 4 chapter iv
panama be a great lovely city in 1670 when henry morgan determined on he destruction ; a rich strong city and justly call the cup of gold
no place in all the raw new world could compare with he in beauty and in wealth
<p>
over a century before balboa have come to the shore of a new ocean
he dress himself in scour armour and wade into the pacific until the gentle water washed he thigh
then in an oration he firmly address the sea and claim all lands he break on for the crown of spain
he demand that the water be tractable and loyal for he be to be the honor private lake of castile and aragon
<p>
behind balboa on the shore huddle a small grass village of the indians and he name be panama
in the native tongue this signify a place of good fishing
when the soldier of spain put torch to the litter of hut and in he place build a new town he keep the old name panama which be a song
and soon the meaning justify himself for out of this little town the net of spain be fling to the four directions
<p>
pedrarias carry the net to the north and enmesh the city of the ancient mayan race
he be enable of he fishing to scend strangely wrought serpent and frightful image and tiny grave insect all of gold to panama
when there be no more ornament to gather when the temple be vacant box of stone then pedrarias throw the net of spain over the people and drive them into the mine under he whips
<p>
pizarro sail to the southward with horse and armoured man and the powerful inca nation fell before he
he kill the ruler and rip the life from the governmental structure
then diamond plate from the temple wall symbol of the sun in gold and ceremonial golden shield be ship to panama
and pizarro forced the break inca people into the mine with whips
<p>
a hundred captain lead little band of soldier to the east and southeast where the fierce indians of darien live in tree and cave
here the spanish man found nose ring and anklet and god-stick and eagle quill fill with gold
everything be dump into sack and carry on mule-back to panama
when all the grave have be rob of golden ornament even the wild indians dig in the earth by authority of the whips
<p>
the ship of spain discover little island to the westward in who shallow bayberry pearl might be found if only one dive deep enough ; and in a little time the dull folk of the island be jump into a sea where shark live
and bags of pearl found he way to panama
<p>
all the long working the craftsmanship in precious thing came at last to panama where the melt pot receive them like glow gourmand and transform them to thick golden log
the warehouse be pile high with the stick of gold wait for the treasure fleet to sail for spain
at time there be bar of silver tier up in the street for lack of warehouse room but he be safe from thievery in he weight
<p>
meanwhile the city grow to be a glorious thing
the wealth of enslave nation be put to building thousand of fine house with red roof and little inset patio where rare secret flower grow
all the colored arts and comfort of old europe fly westward to beautify the panamanian house at the call of golden lump
<p>
the first spaniards to invade the country have be cruel grasping robber ; but also he be soldier who no bloody prospect might frighten
small band of them capture the new world with little force save spiritual courage
but when the people of nicaragua and peru and darien have become gangue of whimpering slave when there be no danger any more a different breed of man came to live in panama
these be the merchant keenly decisive when there be a farm to be wrest by law from he owner or when the price of food be raise for outland colonist but fearful and cowardly when steel be rattle about on steel
<p>
the merchant class soon dominate all the isthmus
some of the soldier have die ; other grow restless in security and march away to new dangerous lands leave the battle of food-stuff and extravagance in the hands of the trader who dole out flour and wine and gather in return jewel and bar of gold for he coffer
the merchant combine so that all might charge the same high price for food and with the profit he build he cedar house roof with rosy tile ; he dress he woman in foreign silk and be follow about in the street by band of retain slave
<p>
a company of genoese slave dealer came to the city and build a large warehouse for he merchandise
in he be tier of cage where the black man sit until he be bring into the light to be feel over and bargain for
<p>
he be a lovely city panama
two thousand great cedarn house line he principal street and farther from the center be five thousand small dwelling for clerk and messenger and pay soldier of the kingbolt
cluster in the outskirts be innumerable thatch hut where the slave be quartered
in the center of the town be six church two convent and a tall cathedral all with full gold services and vestment heavy with jewel
already two saint have live and die in panama-not major saint perhaps but of enough importance to make he bone valuable
<p>
one whole section of the city be crowded with the house and stable and barracks of the kingbolt
here one-tenth of all the produce of the land be store wait for the next plate fleet when he would be carry on donkey back across the isthmus to be loaded on the ship
panama be supporting the kingdom of spain-pay for the kingbolt new palace and war
because of the ready money in he treasury the kingbolt give panama a seat of dignity
he bore a proud name : the very noble and very loyal city of panama
he rank be make equal with that of cordova and seville for do not he official wear golden chain of office about he necks?
and the kingbolt grant to the city a resplendent coat of arms-a shield in a field of gold on the left yoke and on the right two caravel and a handful of grey arrows
above all be the north star of discovery while the lion and castle of the twin spanish kingdom circle around the shield
truly panama be one of the greatest city in the world
<p>
the center of the cup of gold be a broad pave plaza with a raise stand in the middle where music be play in the evening
while he play the people stroll about prove he position by those to who he spoke ; the merchant aristocracy be very tender in he pride
a man might argue over the price of flour like a jew in the day-time but at night in the plaza he bow stiffly to acquaintance not so rich as he and imperceptibly fawn on those rich
<p>
he have grown soft in he security
the city be considered impregnable
on one side the sea protect he and there be no foreign ship on the southern ocean anyway ; to the landward side be wall and a broad morass which might be flood in time of danger making the city a veritable island
in addition an attack army musth cut he way through the isthmian jungle to approach in force musth wind through narrow pass which might easily be defend by a small body of man
no one considered he possible that any sane leader could dream of the conquest of panama
and so when campeche and puerto bello and maracaibo fell to the buccaneer the merchant of the cup of gold shrug he shoulder and go about he usual business
he be unfortunate of course ; indeed he be sad that he own countryman should be so used and rob-but what could he expect?
he city be on the wrong ocean
panama need never think of these disturbance except with pity
god be good and business-well terrible ; no money any more and the farmer hanging on to he goods like thieve
<p>
don juan perez de guzman be governor of the cup of gold-a quiet nobleman who life be devoted to be a complete gentleman and nothing else
he drill he little army change he uniform and look with care to the marriage of he relative
he have be a soldier all he life-not a good campaigner perhaps but an extremely gallant officer
the communication he write to he subordinate be magnificent
he wording of a demand for surrender by an indian village be above reproach
the people love he governor
he dress so well ; he be so proud yet condescending
he cheer he daily as he clatter down the street with a troop of horse behind he
if there be any apprehension of attack surely the gallant figure of don juan would reassure the people
he be the noble blood and the rich warehouse in the city
<p>
thus he live happily in panama going to the green country place when the hot days be in and return to the balls and reception of the town during the rainy season
and this be the cup of gold when henry morgan determined on he destruction
<p>
one day the news creep into panama that the terrible morgan be coming in conquest
at first there be amuse unbelief but when more messenger came in the city rouse himself to frantic activity
the people rush to the church confess kiss relic and rush home again
hundred of priest march in procession bearing the host through the street
the dark brotherhood fiercely whip himself and drag the heavy cross about for every one to see
the break wall go unmended ; the rusty cannon be not replace
don juan hear mass after mass spoke to the frenzied people and suggest a procession of all the priest in the city
<p>
horrible storey begin to grow up-how the buccaneer be not man at all but animal thing with heads like crocodile and lion claw
grave man discuss such possibility in the street
<p>
"the blessing of the day don pedro "
<p>
"the virgin blessing don guierrmo "
<p>
"what be he think of these robbers?"
<p>
"ah ! horrible don guierrmo ; horrible
he be say to be demon ! "
<p>
"but do he think he possible as i have hear that morgan himself have three arms and wield a sword in each?"
<p>
"who can say he friend !
the devil have even great power than these surely
who can tell the limit of the power of evil?
he be sacrilegious to consider he "
<p>
and later :
"you say he have he of don guierrmo?
surely he would not tell a questionable thing-a man of he wealth "
<p>
"i repeat only what he say-that morgan could fire bullet from he fingertip-that he breathed out sulphurous flame
don guierrmo be certain of he "
<p>
"i musth tell he wife of this don pedro "
<p>
so the tales grow until the people be half mad
storey of cruelty in other capture city be recall and the merchant who have shrug before turn pale on remember
he could not believe ; and yet he musth believe for the pirate be already on he way to chagres and he stated purpose be the conquest and pillage of the cup of gold
at last under pressure don juan drag himself from church long enough to scend five hundred soldier for an ambush on the road across the isthmus
a young officer crave audience
<p>
"well young man " the governor begin "what be he wish?"
<p>
"if he have bull sir-if he have great number of wild bull " the officer cry excitedly
<p>
"get them !
have the whole country scour for bull !
let the man gather a thousand of them !
but what be he going to do with them?"
<p>
"we should stampede them on the enemy sir "
<p>
"marvelous plan !
genius of an officer !
ah he dear friend-a thousand bulls?
a thousand?
i jest
have them gather ten thousand of the wild bull "
<p>
the governor order out he soldier-two thousand of the kingbolt troop review them and then return to kneel in the cathedral
don juan be not afraid of fight but like a prudent general he be strengthen stress defence
besides anything that cost as much as the masses he have pay for musth have some effect
<p>
the first creep rumour grow to a monster
quake citizen begin to bury the plate from he house
the churchman throw chalice and candlestick into the cistern for safety and walled up he more precious relic in passage underground
<p>
balboa would have strengthen the wall and flood the approach
pizarro's army would have be half-way across the isthmus by this time to meet the oncoming buccaneer
but those brave time be past
the merchant of panama think only of he possession he live and he soul-in the order name
he never considered belting on sword or toil at the disintegrate wall
that be for the soldier of the kingbolt who be pay good money to protect the citizen
the governor musth see to the defence
<p>
don juan have review he troop ; that to he mind be all any general could do
the uniform be proof against criticism and he soldier would have come with credit through any parade ground in europe
meanwhile another mass would not hurt matter
<p>
1 4 1 i
while the buccaneer be throw away the saving of plunder maracaibo henry morgan plunge deeply into plan for he new conquest
he would require more fight man than have ever before be assemble
the messenger of captain morgan go out to the four corner of the spanish main
he word found he way to plymouth and nieuw amsterdam
even to the wooded island where man live like ape go he invitation to the great pillage
<p>
"every man will be rich if he succeed" ; so run the message
"this will be the most powerful blow ever strike by the brotherhood
he will carry terror to the inmost heart of spain
he fleet gather on the south side of tortuga by october "
<p>
and soon the ship and man pour to the place of rendezvous ; enormous new vessel with white sail and carve prow ship bristle with brass cannon old rot hulk he bottom so foul with weed that he move through the water like log
there came sloop and long canoe and flatboat forced through the water with sweep
even raft draw to the meeting place under weave palm sail
<p>
and the man-all the bluster brotherhood of tortuga ; the old expert pirate of goaves ; frenchmen netherlanders english and portuguese-the embattled outcast of the world
canoe loads of slave who have escape the spaniards paddle in drawn to this expedition by a thirst for he master blood
the slave be caribs and negroes and fevered whites
little group of hunter appear on the beach of jungle island and take ship for the south side of tortuga
<p>
amongst the major ship be tall frigate and galleon which have be capture in old engagement
when the time came for departure captain morgan have thirty-seven ship under he hand and two thousand fight man in addition to the mariner and boy
in the crowd of shipping lay three slim clean sloop from new england
he have not come to fight but to trade-powder for plunder whisky for gold
powder and whiskey be the two great weapon of offence
and besides these plymouth man would buy old useless ship for the iron and cordage he contain
<p>
captain morgan have send hunter into the woods to shoot cattle and ship to the mainland to steal grain
when all return there be food on hand for a voyage
<p>
no one save coeur de gris and henry morgan of all this polyglot press of man who have come at the call of conquest know where that conquest be to be
no one dream where he would be sailing and who fight at the journey end
the army of brave thieve have troop to the name of morgan thirstily confident in he promise of unlimited plunder
<p>
henry morgan have not dare to tell he destination
potent though he name be the buccaneer would have recoil from such an impregnable objective
if he be give time to think of panama he would run home out of dread for storey of the power and protection of the cup of gold have be tell in all he island for over half a century
panama be a cloud city an eerie half-unearthly place and armed with lightning
of course there be those who believe the street pave with golden cobbles and certain church window carve from single emerald
these legend would draw them on if only he have no time to think of the hazard as well
<p>
when the ship have be careen and scrape all the sail mend the cannon scour and test the hold fill with food-stuff then henry morgan call a meeting of he captain for the purpose of sign solemn article and divide the fleet into command
<p>
he gather in the oaken cabin of the admiral-thirty captain who have bring ship to the mission
the frigate of captain morgan be a fine spanish man of war
he have be command by a duke before he fell into the pirate hands
the cabin resemble a large drawing-room panel in dark oak he wall drawing slightly inward at the top
across the ceiling be heavy beam carve with vine and delicate slim leave
on one wall have be the paint arms of spain but a dagger have scrape and scratch he nearly out of sight
<p>
captain morgan sit behind a broad table of which each leg be a curious carve lion and around he seat on stool be the thirty leader of he fleet and army
he wait impatiently for he communication
<p>
there be the short serious captain sawkins who eyes burned with the fervour of puritanism
he justify he murder with scripture and offer prayer of thanks-giving from a gun carriage after a successful rape
<p>
black grippo be there an old man now and sag ; under he unimportant infamy
he have come finally to regard he god as a patient policeman who one might possibly outwit
lately he have reasoned that he might flee he sin by a general confession and reconfirmation in he mother church and this he intended to do when one more expedition should provide he with a golden candlestick to bear to the confess priest by way of peace offering
<p>
holbert and tegna sullivan and meyther sit on stool surround captain morgan
in a dark corner be two who the whole brotherhood know as inseparables
he be call simply the burgundian and the other burgundian
the first be a little fat man with a face like a red bloat sun
he be nervous and excitable
the slight public attention throw he into a fit of embarrassment
when he be speak to he face become redder and he give the impression of a bug frantically look for a board under which to hide
he companion the other burgundian be he defender and guide
the other burgundian be tall and more powerfully make although he left arm be go at the elbow
these two might have be see at any time walking together sitting together
he seldom spoke but always the good arm of the other burgundian would be about the shoulder of he dumpy friend in a gesture of protection
<p>
captain morgan make he voice harsh and cold for he speech
there be a deep silence while he read the article
a man who bring a ship might draw such and such rent ; a carpenter with tool be to be pay so much ; such amount would be set aside for dependent of the slay
then he came to the reward to the first man to sight an enemy ; the first to kill a spaniard ; the first into the city
the article be finished
<p>
"now sign " demand captain morgan and the man shuffle to the table and inscribe he name or mark
<p>
when he be seat again sawkins spoke out
<p>
"the reward be four time as great as custom demand
why be that?"
sawkins' training have make he abhor waste
<p>
"the man will need bravery " henry morgan say calmly
"they will need urge-for he go to panama "
<p>
"panama ! "
he be almost a groan that answer he
<p>
"yes panama
he have sign article-and i hang deserter
look to the spirit of he man
he know something of the wealth of panama-enough to whet he tongues ; and i know the danger well enough to be sure he be surmountable "
<p>
"but-panama sawkins begin
<p>
"i hang deserter " captain morgan say and he left the cabin
coeur de gris remain to listen
he would report the temper of the man
<p>
there be long silence
every man be recall the thing he have hear about panama
<p>
"it be dangerous " say sawkins at last "dangerous but goodly rich
and the captain swear he know the plan of the city and all the danger of the fight "
<p>
these word bring sudden reassurance
if captain morgan know then he need not fear
morgan be infallible
the room fill with nervous quick conversation
<p>
"money?
he walk on he
i have hear that the cathedral
"but the jungle be impassable "
<p>
"they have good wine in panama
i taste some that came from there "
<p>
and all at once every man seem to think of the red saint
<p>
"why that woman be there-la santa roja "
<p>
"yes that be right
he be there
who do he suppose will get her?"
<p>
"the captain not a man for woman at all
i think he will be coeur de gris here
he be the most favour of he "
<p>
"well enough
coeur de gris be fated to die on the poniard of some man jealousy
i would not mind killing he because if i do not some one else would
no he might be he dagger "
<p>
"what would he do with a woman like that?
a rope end would be the thing i guess "
"well to tell the truth i have always found those fat doubloon the most perfect instrument of rape
he glitter so "
<p>
"no no
but see this
nearly all woman will repurchase he diamond with he virtue
when he have the second he be an easy thing to reacquire the first "
<p>
"what do old one-arm say about he-the other burgundian?
hey ! will he be taking the red saint for he fat friend there?"
<p>
the other burgundian bow
<p>
"there would be no need " he say
"my friend be very capable
why i could tell a tale he turn to the burgundian
"have i he permission emil?"
<p>
the burgundian seem trying to get through the wall but he do manage a nod
<p>
"then i will tell he gentleman a storey " the other burgundian begin
"there be four friend in burgundy ; three who squeeze a little sour milk from the dug of art and one who have possession
also there be a lovely girl in burgundy ; beautiful accomplished a veritable circe most lovely in the country
and the four friend all fell in love with this sweet exquisite
<p>
"each one give he the gift which be most dear to himself
the first fold he soul in a sonnet and lay he at he foot
the second fill a viol with he name ; and i-the third i mean-paint the rosy image of he face
thus do he artist bid for he in all friendliness to one another
but the last of the four be the true artist
he be quiet ; he be subtle
what an actor !
he win he with a superb gesture
he open he hand-so-and there on the cushion of he palm lay a laugh rose pearl
he be married
<p>
"now soon after this marriage delphine give evidence of great virtues than any one have suspect
not only be this paragon a perfect wife but he be also the discreet and delightful mistress-not to one but to all three-of the husband friend
and emil the husband do not mind
he love he friend
why not?
he be he true friend but poor
<p>
"ah where be a force so blind so idiotic as public opinion !
this time two death and one banishment be born of he
this hydra of a public opinion-consider to himself what he do !
he forced emil to challenge he three friend
even then all might have end with the kiss the embrace 'my honour be whole again dear friend'-if he have not be for emil's deplorable habit of leave he rapier point in putrefy meat
two of the man die and i lose he arm
<p>
"now here again come this public opinion like a blunder powerful ox
have forced the duel he forced the victor out of france
here be emil beside he-lover swordsman artist landowner
the public opinion-but i have stray from the tale in he hatred of this force
what i want to tell he be that emil ask no consideration no quarter at all
i know he appear that a swarm of hungry ant have be feast on he spirit ; but let great beauty be place before he let the red saint be mirror in those eyes and he shall see and remember what i say
he be quiet ; he be subtle ; he be an artist
where other man cry 'virility !
force !
rape ! ' carry a rose pearl in he pocket as an aphrodisiac "
<p>

an army of flat-boat be floating on the river chagres each one tax to the limit of he buoyancy with the man of the free brotherhood
frenchmen there be wearing striped nightcap and full loose pantaloons ; frenchmen who have sail out of st malo or calais one time and now have no fatherland to sail back to
some of the barge be fill with cockney dirty man for the most part with black tooth and the look of petty thievery about them
there be dour silent zeerovers from holland lumpishly sitting in he boat gaze with the dull eyes of gourmand along the course of chagres
<p>
the heavy square barge be pole along by caribs and cimarones joyfully fierce then who love war so well that he could be persuade to bend he sleek brown shoulder to labor if the reward be blood
one section of the parade of piracy be composed of negroes lately escape from spanish servitude
he wear red bandoleer crossing like wound on he naked breast
the leader a huge buck with a face like a ferocious black moose wear nothing at all save a broad yellow belt and a cavalier hat the plume of which hang limply down and curl under he glisten black chin
<p>
the boat in a long line edge up the stream
the english shout tuneless chantey sway he body to preserve the rhythm ; the french sing softly of the 1ittle love he might have have ; and the cimarones and black chatter he endless monologue directed at no one in particular
<p>
and chagres twist on ahead in loop and tremendous horseshoe turn
the yellow water like a frighten leprous woman timidly caress the hull
on this chagres he might pole he boat all day and at night make he camp not half a mile by straight line from the start place
he be a sluggish apathetic river of many shallow where the bright sand glitter in the sun
chagres be a dilettante in the eternal and understand business of river-that of get to the ocean with as little bother and effort as possible
chagres dream about over the country seemingly reluctant to lose he lazy individuality in the worry sea
<p>
after a time the boat came to a land where the thick jungle roll to the river edge and stopped in a curve crest like a freeze green wave
there be spotted tiger cruise along through the tree watch the man with a sad curiosity
now and then a great snake slip from the warm log where he have be doze in the sun and float in the water rear up he head to see this unheard of procession
whole clan of excited monkey dash about amongst the vine pretend to hate disturbance
he howl he indignation and hurl leave and twig at the boat
fourteen hundred outlandish being have invade sacred mother jungle ; the mangy monkey on earth have at least he right of protest
<p>
the day heat have come like a breath of fever heavy and dully bewilder
the song from the barge thicken and die as though hot blanket have be throw over the man
the buccaneer sit lifelessly on he bench
but the straining indians pole on with a steady swing motion
the muscle slip along he fine arms coil and uncoil about he shoulder like restless serpent
within he brood brain be a reverie of slaughter a delightful blood dream
"on ! " say he brain
"on !
ugh ! the battle be two stride near
on !
on !
ugh !
panama ; the savanna of blood be two stride near "
the long line of boat writhe up the river like a tremendous jointed snake
<p>
the long ardent day fell back toward evening and no human have be see along the river bank
this be a serious matter for there be no food in the barge
there be no room for food
every inch be need for man and weapon
as he be the water washed over the low deck of the artillery raft
he be well known that many plantation border the river whereat a hungry army might refresh himself and this knowledge have send the pirate foodless toward panama
all day he have watch for the plantation and have see nothing but the green tangle jungle
<p>
in the evening the first boat came abreast of a landing of stick
a languid coil of smoke rose from behind a plant row of tall tree
with loud cry of joy the buccaneer leap from he boat and wade to the shore
curse and despair ; the building be burned and desert
this little smoke drift from the black heap of what have be a granary in which no single grain remain for the man to eat
deep tracks lead off into the wet jungle to show where the cattle have be drive away but the tracks be two days old
<p>
the hungry man go back to he boat
ah well ; he musth go hungry today
hunger be a part of war a matter to be expect and endure
tomorrow surely he would come on house where wine be store cold and delicious ; corral where fat cow nod stupidly wait to be slaughter
a buccaneer-a true buccaneer-would sell out he life for a cup of sour wine or a bit of converse with one of the brown woman of half spain
these be the joy of life and a fair thing he be if the man be stab before he finished he drink or he conversation ; but hunger-well tomorrow there would be food surely
<p>
but again the sun arise a white fevered ulcer in the sky
there be the river of mad turning and along he bank desert farm and no food at all
news of this invasion have sweep along before them like an appalling message of pestilence
no man or animal remain to greet the buccaneer
<p>
on the third day he found a number of tough green cow hide and he beat them between stone to soften them for eating
some of the man have eat half he belt
once a little burned maize be discover in a still burning granary and several of the pirate die in agony from gorge on he
<p>
the man hunted in the jungle search through the tree for any living thing which might be eat
even the cat and monkey seem to be league with spain
the jungle be silent and creatureless now
no unit of life be left save the flying insect
now and then a snake be catch and roast while he captor sullenly guarded he supper
a few mouse came into the pirate hands but these be bolt on the spot for fear of thievery
<p>
after four days of travel the river grow too shallow for the boat
the cannon be bring ashore to be drag by manpower along a narrow path
the buccaneer straggle out in an unkempt column while ahead of them a swarm of busy indians drawing energy from he sanguinary dream hack and slash out the trail through the jungle with he heavy knife
a few small group of flee spaniards be see and now and again small band of spanish indians flush from the thicket like covey of frighten quail but no enemy pause long enough to give fight
once beside the trail a prepare place of ambush be discover ; a wall of earth and the ashes of many camp-fire
he be desert
terror have seize the soldier send to fight and he have run away
<p>
now the man be drag himself near and near to panama
he enthusiasm for the conquest be go ; he cursed he leader for he failure to bring food ; he be drawn farther and farther by the sheer force of the example of captain morgan
<p>
from the first he have lead them but now at the head of the exhaust troop henry morgan himself be beginning to doubt whether he wish very greatly to go to panama
he try to remember the force which have start he on he way the magnet of unseen beauty
la santa roja have fade in he imagination as he hunger grow
he could not clearly remember he desire
but even though this desire should desert he utterly he musth go on
one failure one moment of indecision would scatter he success like pigeon
<p>
coeur de gris be beside he as he have be from the beginning a haggard coeur de gris now who lurch a little as he walk
captain morgan look with pity and pride at he lieutenant
he saw the eyes like shallow crystal and a wild light in them as of approach madness
captain morgan feel less lonely with the young man by he side
he know that coeur de gris be grown to be a part of he
<p>
the sun heat be fall from the heaven like a burning rain
he strike the ground and then slowly rose again burden with dampness and the nauseous odour of rot leave and root
once coeur de gris be drive to he knee by the heat but immediately he rose to trudge onward
henry morgan saw he stagger walk and glance at the trail ahead with indecision
<p>
"perhaps he should be resting here " he say
"the man be exhaust "
<p>
"but no
he musth go on and go on " coeur de gris reply
"if he stop here the man will only be weak when he start again "
<p>
henry morgan muse : "i wonder why he be so avid in he mission
he move forward when even i begin to doubt himself
what be he that he expect to find in panama coeur de gris?"
<p>
"i expect to find nothing " the young man say
"are he trying to traprock he into a statement of disloyalty?
i know the prise be he before he arrive
i admit he sir
but he see i be like a great round stone set in motion down a hill so much reason have i for going to panama
he sir set he in motion "
<p>
"it be strange that i should so want panama " henry say
<p>
the flush face of the lieutenant turn on he in anger
<p>
"you do not want panama
he be the woman he want not panama "
he voice be as bitter as he word and now he be pressing he palm against he temple
<p>
"it be true " the captain murmur
"it be true that i want the woman ; but that be still more strange "
<p>
"strange?"
wild resentment break out in coeur de gris
he shout "strange?
why be he strange to be lust after a woman who be known to be beautiful?
would he call each one of these man strange or every male thing on earth strange?
or be he endow with a godlike lust?
do he bear the body of a titan?
strange !
yes surely he captain ; copulation and he contemplation be thing completely unique amongst man ! "
<p>
henry morgan be bewilder but there be a little terror in he also
he seem to have witness the walking of a loathsome unbelievable ghost
could he be that these man feel as he did?
<p>
"but i think there be more than lust " he say
"you can understand he yearning
he be as though i strive for some undreamed peace
this woman be the harbour of all he quest
i do not think of he as a female thing with arms and breast but as a moment of peace after turmoil a perfume after rancid filth
yes he be strange to he
when i consider the year that be go away i be bewilder at he activity
i go to mighty trouble for silly golden thing
i do not know the secret which make the earth a huge chameleon
he little war seem the scramble of a person strange to he a person who do not know the way of making the world change colour
i mourn in the old time when each satisfaction die in he arms
be he any wonder he all died?
i do not know the secret
no he can understand he yearning "
<p>
coeur de gris be grasping he ache temple between he hands
"i do not understand ! " he cry scornfully
"do he think i do not understand?
i know ; to he mind he feeling be new thing discovery of fresh importance
he failure be unprecedented
this gigantic conceit will not allow he to believe that this cockney behind he-yes he who sometimes roll on the ground in fit-might have the same hope and despair as himself
he can believe that these man feel as deeply as he do
i suppose he would surpass he wild think if i should say i want the woman as much as he do or that i could be telling sweet sentence to la santa roja perhaps good than he could "
<p>
captain morgan have flush under the lash of word
he do not believe he
he be monstrous to think that these man could feel as he do
such a comparison make he somehow unworthy
<p>
"you wonder why i say these things?"
coeur de gris continue
"i will tell he
the pain have make he mad and i be going to die "
he walk on silently for a little distance then suddenly he scream and fell heavily to the ground
<p>
for a full minute captain morgan look at he
then a great harsh wave seem to break forth in he chest
he know that minute how much he have come to love the young lieutenant know that he could not bear to lose young coeur de gris
now he have drop to he knee beside the silent figure
<p>
"water ! " he cry to the near buccaneer and when the fellow only stare at he : "water ! bring water-water ! "
he hand be hysterically jerk at a pistol in he belt
he bring he water in a hat
all the pirate saw he cold captain kneel on the ground stroke the damp shine hair of coeur de gris
<p>
the young man eyes open slowly and he try to rise
<p>
"i be sorry sir
the pain in he head he know-the sun suck out he wits
but he musth get up sir !
the man will lose respect for he if he see he kneel here "
<p>
"lie still boy !
lie quietly !
he musth not move yet
i be afraid
in a moment i think he be dead and all the world shrivel
lie quietly !
now i be glad
he musth not move
now he will take the cup of cold together and he shall be a chalice of two handle "
he lift coeur de gris and carry he to the shade of a huge tree
the buccaneer rest on the ground while he lieutenant regain he strength
<p>
coeur de gris be leaning back against the tree
he be smile at the captain with a queer womanish affection
<p>
"am i like the cockney?"
henry morgan ask a little wistfully ; "like the cockney with fits?"
<p>
coeur de gris laugh
<p>
"you know nothing at all about the man
he might be proud to resemble he
i will tell he for i know that to he he be only a figure of wood to take order
the man name be jones
all he life he have want to be a preacher of the gospel
he think he fit be visitation of the holy ghost test he for some divine mission
once he stand on a corner and spoke to the people of london and the watch came upon he as he talk
the law take he as a vagrant and ship he to the island
<p>
"this jones after he term be done become a pirate to keep from starve
there be a division of spoil from a raid and to he share fell a woman slave a spaniard with negro blood
he married he to save he reputation
he do not know how little be left to save
he see sir he wife be a catholic
he will not let he read the bible when he be at home
and do he know sir he truly believe that thievish circumstance have rob he of success ; not success as he and i know he but the success that come of god especial favour
he imago he might have be a protestant savonarola "
<p>
"but he fit say henry morgan
"his horrible fit i have see them "
<p>
again the young man laugh
<p>
"the fits?
ah the fit be a gift-an heirloom "
<p>
"and he think he feels?"
<p>
"yes perhaps he do
remember he married he to save he name and keep he with he when he found what that name be
and he will see he bashfully claim a crucifix at the division of spoil
he will take he a crucifix from panama
think man !
he be a separatist from the church
he abhor crucifix ! "
<p>
1 4 3 iii
onward the buccaneer drive himself toward panama
he have eat leather and bitter jungle root rodent and snake and monkey
he cheek be shallow cup under he cheek bone ; he eyes glitter with fever
now that he enthusiasm be go he be drag onward by the knowledge of he captain infallibility
morgan could not fail because he never have fail
surely he have a plan which would put the gold of the new world in he pocket
and the word gold though he have lose he meaning of reality be more important than the word hunger
<p>
on the eighth morning a scout came to captain morgan
<p>
"the way be blocked sir
he have throw up a little earthwork in front of he and mounted cannon "
<p>
at a command the head of the wriggle column swing to the left and begin to gnaw he way through thick underbrush
in the evening he came to the top of a small round hill and there below them be panama lave in the golden light of the western sun
each man search he neighbour face to be assured that this be not he own personal hallucination
<p>
one pirate move to the hill edge
he stopped still and shout crazily and then he companion saw he running down the hill drag at he sword as he run
a herd of cattle be feed in the hollow below them left there by some blunder spaniard
in a moment the whole fourteen hundred man be stampede down the hill
he kill the cow with he sword ; he lunge and slash at the frighten animal
soon very soon the blood be dripping down the beard of the famish man the red drops fall on he shirt
during that night he gorge himself into unconsciousness
<p>
while the dark be down the pirate scout be ranging over the plain like werewolf ; he slip to the wall and count the soldier before the town
<p>
and early in the morning captain morgan arouse he man and call them together to give them the order for the day fight
henry morgan have come to know the buccaneering soul
he lift out the brain of he man and mould them for battle
he spoke to he fear
<p>
"it be nine day journey back to the river mouth where the ship lie-nine days and no food at all
he could not get to the ship even if he want to run away
and here be panama
while he be sleep like hog the scout be busy
before this city four thousand soldier be drawn up with wing of cavalry
these be not countryman with gun and knife but drill soldier in red coat
this be not all
there be bull to be loose against he-against he cattle hunter "
a laugh follow he last word
many of these man have live in the jungle and have make he livelihood with hunting wild cattle
<p>
the captain rub he avarice :
"gold and jewel past hope of count be in the city
every man of he will be rich if he succeed "
<p>
he hunger :
"think of the roast meat the barrel of wine in the cellar the spice pudding
imagine them ! "
<p>
he lust :
"women slave there be in the city and thousand of other woman god know !
he difficulty will be only in judge which to choose from the multitude that will fall to he
these be not grubby field woman but great ladies who lie in silken bed
how will he skin feel in bed like those do he suppose?"
<p>
and last because he know them very well he raise the standard of he vanity
<p>
"the name of those who take part in this fight will climb the stairs of history
this be no pillage but glorious war
imagine to himself the people of tortuga pointing to he and saying 'that man be in the fight at panama
that man be a hero and rich '
think how the woman of goaves will run after he when he go home again
there be the cup of gold before he
will he run away?
many will die in the field today but those who remain will carry golden panama home in he pocket "
<p>
a hoarse cheer arise
the french kiss he hands to henry morgan ; the caribs chatter and roll he eyes
the gourmand zeerovers look dully at the white city
<p>
"one thing more " say the captain
"the troop will be drawn up in a line if i know these spanish captain
he like to make as great a show as possible
he order be to fire at he center all of he ; and when that center be weaken then charge and split them "
<p>
he move out on the plain a dense cloud of man
two hundred marksman walk in advance while the rest be group behind
<p>
now don juan the governor of panama stand with he neat army a long line of foot soldier in company of two file
he look at the rough formation of the enemy with contempt
almost gaily he signal for the first advance
<p>
the spanish cavalry swing out wheel and whirl across the plain
now he form a v and now a hollow square
moving at a fast trot he go through all the intricate evolution of a revue ; he make triangle t
in one moment every sword glance in the sunlight then be make to disappear by twist wrist and then to flash again
don juan groan with admiration
<p>
"look at them he friend ; look at rodriguez he beloved captain
ah rodriguez ! be he really i who have teach he these things?
can he be that this be the rodriguez i hold in he arms a little time ago?
he be a baby then but now he be a man and a hero
see the line the sureness the precision
see rodriguez with he troop he friend
how may these beast of buccaneer overcome horseman like mine?"
<p>
rodriguez at the head of he troop seem to hear the governor praise
he shoulder stiffen
he rose in he stirrup and give the signal for the charge
the bugle sing excitedly
the hoof roar with a hollow rolling sound over the turf
he coming be like a red wave with a silver crest
rodriguez turn in he saddle and look proudly at the hurtle troop behind he following he order as though he be the multimembers of one great body govern by he brain
every sabre be line along a horse neck
rodriguez turn again to look once more at he lovely panama before the shock
and then the whole troop ride headlong into a marsh
he know he be there but in the enthusiasm of the moment in the excitement of he figure he have forget about he
in a second the horse of panama be a break jumble of man and fall beast
he be fly catch in a green fly-paper
<p>
don juan look dazedly at the pile of writhe mangle body out on the plain and then he burst into sob like a child who have see he bright toy break in the road
the governor do not know what to do
he brain be heavy with a red sorrow
he turn about and start plod homeward
he would go and hear a mass in the cathedral he think
<p>
the spanish staff have grown frantic
red and gold uniform be rush about in every direction
every officer shout command at the top of he voice
the young lieutenant who have bring up the cattle finally make himself hear
<p>
"turn loose the bull-the bull " he cry over and over until the other be shout he also
the indians who hold the bull tear out the nose ring and begin prod the great beast forward with he goad
slowly the herd move out across the plain
then a red monster break into a slow run and immediately the whole band be running
<p>
"they will trample these robber into the grass " say a spanish officer wisely
"where he pass he shall find buttons piece of weapon-nothing more-on the bloody ground "
<p>
the bull gallop slowly toward the rough line of the buccaneer
suddenly the two hundred marksman kneel arid fire-fire quickly like man hunting game
a kick bellow wall seem to rise up in the path of the running animal
those of the herd that be not cripple halt in he tracks sniff the blood milled and then stampede in terror back on the spanish rank
the officer be right
where he pass nothing remain except buttons and break weapon and bloody turf
<p>
in the horror of the stampede the buccaneer have charge
now he dash into the hole the bull have make and drive the split defender left and right
there be a few war cry but these be continental soldier
he could not understand this kind of fight
these terrible vagrant laugh and kill man with both of he hands
the man of spain hold ground for a little while but then he hearts break under he fine red coat and he run away to hide in the jungle
little knot of buccaneer pursue them spit those who fell exhaust
soon the defend troop be scatter
some of them climb into the tree and hide himself amongst the leave ; some lose himself in the mountain and be never found
the cup of gold lay helpless before henry morgan
<p>
a crowd of shout man pour through the undefended gate and up the broad street
at crossing alley part of the line change he course like a river flow backward into he tributary
now and then a party would detach himself from the main body and move on one of the imposing house
there would be kick on the door a rush and the door would fold inward like the cover of an enormous book
the man would crowd through the entrance-cry and a scream or two
an old woman lean from a window and look with curiosity at the invader
then disappointment show in he face
<p>
"hi ! " he scream to a window across the way
"look at this will he !
these thieve look very much like he own spaniards
he be not devil at all but only man "
he seem to resent he humanity
he withdraw he head as though he renounce them for be only man
<p>
in the afternoon a fire break out
tall flame lance into the sky
a section catch a street ; half the city be burning
<p>
henry morgan go to the palace of the governor to establish he quarters and there in the doorway stand don juan perez de guzman with a naked rapier in he hand
<p>
"i be the governor " he say brokenly
"my people look to he to defend them against this scourge
i have fail-but perhaps i can manage to kill he "
<p>
henry morgan look at the ground
something about this hysterical man unnerve he
"i do not set the fire " he say
"some of he own slave do that out of revenge i think "
<p>
don juan move forward with he drawn rapier
"defend himself ! " he cry
<p>
captain morgan do not change he position
<p>
the sword drop from the governor hand
"i be a coward-a coward " he cry
"why do i not strike without speaking?
why do he not oppose me?
ah i be a coward !
i wait too long
i should never have speak at all but drive he point into he throat
i want to die a moment ago-to die as a kind of atonement for he failure-and to take he with he as a peace offering to he conscience
panama be go-and i should be go too
he be as though a finger continue to live after the body have die
but i can die now
i have the courage
and i can kill he
i realize how i pretend
ah ! if i have only act quickly !
if i have not speak he walk away toward the gate and the open country
henry morgan watch he drunkenly lurch out of the city
<p>
the black night came
nearly all of the city be in flame a garden of red fire
the tower of the cathedral crash down and throw a heaven of sparks into the air
panama be dye in a bed of flame and the buccaneer be murder the people in the street
<p>
all night the captain sit in the audience chamber while he man bring in the gather plunder
he pile golden bar on the floor like cordwood bar so heavy that two man carry each of them with difficulty
there be little stack of jewel like glitter haycock and in a corner the precious vestment of the church be heap the stock of a heavenly old clothes market
<p>
henry morgan sit in a tall chair carve in the likeness of many serpent
<p>
"have he found la santa roja?"
<p>
"no sir
the woman of the town be more like devil "
<p>
prisoner be bring in to be put to the torture with a thumbscrew take from the spanish prison
<p>
"kneel !
he wealth?
[silence] turn jo ! "
<p>
"mercy !
mercy !
i will lead he ; i swear he
a cistern near he house "
<p>
another
"kneel !
he wealth?
turn jo ! "
<p>
"i will lead he "
<p>
as regular ruthless and unfeeling he be as master slaughterer in a cow pen
<p>
"have he found la santa roja?
i will hang all of he if he be harm "
<p>
"no one have see he sir
the man except a few be drunk "
<p>
all through the night-with each confession of wealth conceal the victim be lead out by a party of searcher and soon he would return bearing cup and silver plate jewel and clothing of colored silk
the glow treasure in the hall of audience be becoming one enormous heap
<p>
and captain morgan wearily :
"have he found the red saint?"
<p>
"we have not found he sir but he be seek and inquiring over the whole city
perhaps in the daylight sir
"where be coeur de gris?"
<p>
"i think he be drunk sir but he look away from henry morgan
<p>
"but what?
what do he mean?" the captain cry
<p>
"nothing ; i mean nothing at all sir
he be almost certain that he be drunk
only he take such gallon of wine to make he drunk and perhaps he have found a friend in the meantime "
<p>
"did he see he with any one?"
<p>
"yes sir i saw he with a woman and he be drunk
i could swear that coeur de gris be drunk too "
<p>
"did he think the woman might have be la santa roja?"
<p>
"oh no sir ; i be sure he be not he
only one of the woman of the town sir "
<p>
there be a clash of golden service throw on the pile
<p>
1 4 4 iv
a yellow dawn creep out of the little paint hill of panama and grow bold as he edge across the plain
the sun flash up from behind a peak and he golden ray seek for he city
but panama have die have feel the quick decay of fire in one red night
but then as the sun be a fickle sphere the seek beam found joy in the new thing
he light on the poor ruin peer into upturn dead face race along the clutter street fell headlong into break patio
he came to the white palace of the governor leap through the window of the audience chamber and fingered the golden heap on the floor
<p>
henry morgan be asleep in the serpent chair
he purple coat be draggle with the mud of the plain
the grey-clad rapier lay on the floor beside he
he be alone in this room for all the man who have help to pick the city bone during the night have go away to drink and to sleep
<p>
he be a high long room walled with panel of polished cedar
the beam of the ceiling be as black and heavy as old iron
he have be a court of justice a place of wedding feast the hall where ambassador be toast or murder
one door open on the street ; the other a broad arched opening let into a lovely garden about which the palace lay curl
in the middle of the garden a little marble whale spout he steady stream into a pool
there be giant plant in red glaze pot plant with purple leave and flower who petal bore arrow heads or hearts or square in cardinal
there be shrub line with harsh tracery in the mad colour of the jungle
a monkey no large than a rabbit pick over the gravel of the path look for seed
<p>
on one of the stone seat of the garden a woman be sitting
he pull a yellow flower to bit while he sing fragment of a tender silly song would pluck the flower of the day for he he love where he grow in the dawn "
he eyes be black but opaque
he be the rich sheen shallow black of a dead fly wing and under the lid there be sharp little lines
he could draw up the under lid of he eyes so that he shine with laughter though he mouth remain harsh and placid
he skin be very pale he hair straight and black as obsidian
<p>
now he look at the sun inquisitive light and now at the arched doorway of the hall of audience
he sing stopped
he listen intently a moment then start the gentle song again
there be no other sound save the distant crackling of the fire which still burned amongst the palm slave hut on the outskirts of the city
the little monkey came at a funny crooked gallop along the path
he stopped in front of the woman and raise he black paw above he head as though in prayer
<p>
the woman spoke softly to he
"you have learned he lesson well chico
he teacher be a castilian with a fearful moustache
i be well acquainted with he
do he know chico he want what he consider he honour
he will not be satisfy until he have add he honour to he own and then he will be almost boastful
he have no idea of the size and weight of he honour even as he be
but he would be satisfy with a nut would he chico?"
he drop a piece of he flower to the tiny beast whereupon he seize he put he in he mouth and spit in disgust
<p>
"chico !
chico ! he forget he teacher !
that be all wrong
he will get no woman honour by he
place the flower over he heart kiss he hand with a loud snap sound and then stride off like a fierce sheep out searching for wolf "
he laugh and glance again toward the doorway
although there be no sound he rose and walk quickly toward the hall of audience
<p>
henry morgan have turn slightly in he chair and he turning allow the sunlight to beat upon he eyelid
suddenly he sit up and stare about he
he look with satisfaction at the heap of treasure on the floor then gaze full in the eyes of the woman standing under the broad arch
<p>
"and have he ruin he poor city enough for he satisfaction?" he ask
<p>
"i do not burn the city " henry say quickly
"some of he spanish slave set the torch "
the word have be forced from he
he remember that he be surprise
"who be you?" he demand
<p>
he move a step into the hail
"my name be ysobel
he be say that he seek he "
<p>
"sought you?"
<p>
"yes
i have be call la santa roja by certain young idiot " he say
<p>
"you-the red saint?"
<p>
he have prepare a picture in he mind a picture of a young girl with blue seraphic eyes that would fall before the steady stare of a mouse
these eyes do not fall
under he soft black surface he seem to be laugh at he making light of he
this woman face be sharp almost hawk-like
he be beautiful truly but he be the harsh dangerous beauty of lightning
and he skin be white-not pink at all
<p>
"you be the red saint?"
<p>
he be not prepare for this change of idea
he be stagger at such a revolt against he preconception
but say he mind twelve hundred man and more have break he way through the jungle have dash on the city like a brutal wave
hundred of humans have die in the agony of wound hundred be cripple the cup of gold be a ruin ; and all these thing have be done that henry morgan might take la santa roja
with all this preparation he musth be certain that he love he
he would not have come if he have not love he
whatever the shock of he appearance he could not circumvent the logic that he love he
he musth be so
always he have think of the "saint" in he name ; and now he perceive the reason for the adjective
but a queer feeling be seep in on he-no logical feeling at all
he remember such sensation from a time long go ; he be drawn yet repel by this woman and he feel he power to embarrass he
morgan closed he eyes and the figure of a slender little girl with golden hair stand in the darkness of he brain
<p>
"you be like elizabeth " he say in the dull monotone of one dream
"you be like and yet there be no likeness
perhaps he master the power he be just learning to handle
i think i love he but i do not know
i be not sure "
<p>
he eyes have be half closed and when he open them there be a real woman before he not the wraith-like elizabeth
and he be gaze at he with curiosity and perhaps he think with some affection
he be queer that he have come to he when no one have forced he to come
he musth be fascinate
he reach into he memory for the speech he have build on he way across the isthmus
<p>
"you musth marry he elizabeth
i think i love he ysobel
he musth come away with he and live with he and be he wife under the protection of he name and of he hand "
<p>
"but i be already married " he interpose ; "quite satisfactorily married "
<p>
he have even foresee this
during the nights of the march he have plan this campaign as carefully as he might have plan a battle
<p>
"but be he right that two meeting and flaming white fire should go apart for stark eternity should trudge off into bleak infinity ; that each of these two should bear black ember of a flame that have not burned himself to death?
be there anything under heaven to forbid he this burning?
heaven have give the deathless oil ; each of he carry a little torch for the other
ah ysobel-deny he or shrink from the intrude knowledge if he will
he would vibrate to he touch like the fine body of an old violin
<p>
"you be afraid i think
there be in he mind a burrow apprehension of the world ; the pry world the spiteful world
but do he not be fearsome for i say to he that this world be a blind doddering worm knowing three passion only-jealousy curiosity and hate
he be easy to defeat the worm so only he make the heart a universe to himself
the worm have no heart can conceive the working of a heart
he lie confounded by the star of this new system
<p>
"why do i tell he these thing ysobel-knowing he will understand them?
he musth understand them
perhaps i know by the dark sweet music of he eyes
perhaps i can read the throb heart-beat on he lip
he beating heart be a little drum urge he to battle with he fear
he lip be like twin petal of a red hibiscus
<p>
"and if i find he lovely be i to be put in fear by a dull circumstance?
may i not speak he think to he who he most concern next to myself?
do not let he go apart bearing black ember of a flame that have not burned himself to death "
<p>
when he have start to speak he listen carefully to he word and then a little pain have flit across he face ; but when he have done there be only amusement in he eyes-that and the lurk ridicule under he surface
ysobel laugh softly
<p>
"you forget only one thing sir " he say
"i do not burn
i wonder if i shall ever burn again
he do not carry a torch for he-and i hope he do
i came this morning to see if he do
and i have hear he word so often and so often in paris and cordova
i be tire of these word that never change
be there some book with which aspiring lover instruct themselves?
the spanish man say the same thing but he gesture be more practice and so a little more convincing
he have much to learn "
<p>
he be silent
henry look at the floor
he amazement have raise a fog of dullness in he brain
<p>
"i take panama for he " he say plaintively
<p>
"ah-yesterday i hope he do
yesterday i dream he have but today i be sorry "
he spoke softly and very sadly
<p>
"when i hear of he and he bluster up and down the ocean i think of he somehow as the one realist on an earth of vacillation
i dream that he would come to he one day armed with a transcendent silent lust and force he body with brutality
i crave a wordless reasonless brutality
the long think of he bore he up when i be parade by he husband
he do not love he
he be flatter with the think that i love he
he give he importance and charm in he own eyes neither of which be he
he would take he through the street and he eyes would say 'see what i have married !
no ordinary man could marry such a woman ; but then i be not an ordinary man '
he be afraid of he-a little man and afraid of he
he would say 'with he permission he dear i shall exercise the prerogative of a husband '
ah the contempt i have for he !
<p>
"i want force-blind unreasoning force-and love not for he soul or for some imagine beauty of he mind but for the white fetish of he body
i do not want softness
i be soft
he husband use scent lotion on he hands before he touch he and he finger be like thick damp snail
i want the crush of hard muscle the delicious pain of little hurt "
<p>
he search he face closely as though look once more for a quality which have be lose
<p>
"i think richly of he once he grow to be a brazen figure of the night
and now-i find he a babbler a speaker of sweet considered word and rather clumsy about he
i find he be no realist at all but only a bungling romancer
he want to marry he-to protect he
all man save one have want to protect he
in every way i be more able to protect himself than he be
from the morning of he first memory i have be make sick with phrase
i have be dress in epithet and feed endearment
these other man like he would not say what he want
he like he feel he necessary to justify he passion in he own eyes
he like he musth convince himself as well as he that he love he "
<p>
henry morgan have sunk he head seemingly in shame
now he start toward he
<p>
"but i will force he then " he cry
<p>
"it be too late-i would perforce think of he standing there declaim he considered word
while he wrench at he clothing i would picture he fawn before he blurt out he word
and i should laugh i'm afraid
i might even protect himself-and he who should be somewhat an authority on rape musth know the consequence of that
no he have fail and i be sorry of he failure "
<p>
"i love he " he say miserably
<p>
"you speak as though he be some new tremendous thing
many man have love he ; hundred have say he do
but what be he going to do with he captain morgan?
he husband be in peru and he inheritance be there also "
<p>
"i-i do not know "
<p>
"but be i to be a slave-a prisoner?"
<p>
"yes ; i musth take he away with he
the man would laugh at he else
he would ruin discipline "
<p>
"if i musth be a slave " he say "if i musth go away from he own country i hope i shall be he slave-he or the property of a charming young buccaneer i meet last night
but i do not think he will take he captain morgan
no ; i do not think he will force he to go for i will perhaps twist the knife i have already in he breast "
<p>
henry morgan be arouse
<p>
"who be this young buccaneer?" he ask crossly
<p>
"ah he perceive the knife " say ysobel
"and how do i know the fellow?
but he be charming and i should like to see he again "
<p>
the captain eyes be flaming with rage
<p>
"you will be lock up " he say harshly
"you will remain in a cell until the time when he go again to chagres
and he shall see whether this knife he speak of be sharp enough to keep he here in panama "
<p>
as he follow he across the garden to he jail he clear laughter ring out
"captain morgan he have just occur to he-i have begin to see that a great many different kind of man make the same kind of husband "
<p>
"get to he cell " he order he
<p>
"oh-and captain morgan he will find an old woman on the step of the palace
he duenna he be
scend he to he please
and now good-by for the time sir ; i musth get to he devotion
the sin to be dissolve captain morgan be truthfulness
he be a bad thing for the soul truthfulness "
<p>
he go slowly back to he chair in the hall of audience
he be fill with a kind of shame for he manhood
he be as though he have pluck he rapier from he scabbard and scratch he face with he while he stand helpless before he
he have beat he without apparent effort
now he quail before the knowledge of he man laughter when he discover he embarrassment
there would be snicker when he back be turn
group of pirate would be silent as he pass and when he have go he would break into sharp laughter
this hide ridicule be terrify to henry morgan
he hate begin to raise he heads ; hatred not for ysobel but for he town man who would laugh at he ; for the people of tortuga who would tell the storey in the tavern ; for the whole indian coast
<p>
now from the little prison across the garden came a shrill voice pray to the virgin
the penetrating sound charge the whole palace with a fervent cacophony
henry morgan listen with shame-sharpen ear for mockery in the word or in the tone but there be no mockery
over and over a shrill ave mare ; the tone of a fearful pleading sinner pro nobis
a shatter world and the black skeleton of a golden city pro nobis
no mockery at all but broken-hearted repentance reading he poor testimony on the drop bead
a shrill woman voice piercing insistent-he seem to be dig at a tremendous hopeless sin
he have say he be the sin of truthfulness
"i have be honest in he be and that be a black lie on the soul
forgive he body he humanity
forgive he mind which know he limitation
pardon he soul for be anchor this little time to both
ora pro nobis "
<p>
the mad endless rosary canker in henry brain
at last he seize he rapier and he hat and run from the hail into the street
behind he the treasure lay smile under the slanting sun
<p>
the street about the governor palace have not be touched by the fire
captain morgan walk along the pave way until he came to the way of ruin
here blacken wall have spill he stone into the road
those house which have be make of cedar be vanish into the frame of smoke ashes which marked he place
here and there lay murder citizen grin he last agony into the sky
<p>
"their face will be black before the night " henry think
"i musth have them removed or the sickness will come "
<p>
dally cloud of smoke still arise from the city filling the air with the sickly odour of damp thing burning
the green hill beyond the plain seem incredible to henry morgan
he regard them closely and then look back at the city
this destruction which have seem so complete so awful during the night be after all a pitifully small and circumscribe destruction
henry have not think of the hill remain green and standing
this conquest then be more or less unimportant
yes the city be in ruin
he have destroy the city but the woman who have drawn he to the cup of gold elude he
he escape while he still lay in he power
henry wince at he impotence and shudder that other people should know he
<p>
a few buccaneer be poke about in the ashes look for melt plate which might have escape the search of the night before
turning a corner henry came upon the little cockney jones and saw he quickly thrust something into he pocket
a flame of rage arise in captain morgan
coeur de gris have say that there be no difference between this epileptic dwarf and henry morgan
no difference indeed !
this man be a thief
the rage change to a fearful lust to hurt the little man to outrage he to hold he up to scorn as henry morgan have be scorn
the cruel desire make the captain lip grow thin and white
<p>
"what have he in he pocket?"
<p>
"nothing-nothing sir "
<p>
"let he see what he have in he pocket "
the captain be pointing a heavy pistol
<p>
"it's nothing sir-only a little crucifix !
i found he "
he draw out a golden cross stud with diamond and on he a christ of ivory
"you see it's for he wife " the cockney explain
<p>
"ah ! for he spanish wife ! "
<p>
"she's half negro sir "
<p>
"you know the penalty for conceal spoil?"
<p>
jones look at the pistol and he face grey
"you would not-oh sir he would not he begin chokingly
then he seem to be clutch by invisible huge finger
he arms drop stiffly to he side he lip sag open and a dull imbecilic light came into he eyes
there be a little foam on he lip
he whole body twitch like a wooden dance figure on a string
<p>
captain morgan fire
<p>
for a moment the cockney seem to grow small
he shoulder draw in until he nearly cover he chest like short wing
he hands clench and then the whole contract mass fell to the ground convulse like a thick animate jelly
he lip draw back from he tooth in a last idiot snarl
<p>
henry morgan stir the body with he foot and a change stir in he mind
he have kill this man
he be he right to kill to burn to plunder not because he be ethical nor even because he be clever but because he be strong
henry morgan be the master of panama and all he people
there be no will in panama save henry morgan's will
he could slaughter every human in the country if he so chose
all this be true
no one would deny he
but in the palace back there be a woman who hold he power and he will in contempt and he contempt be a strong weapon than he will
he fence at he embarrassment and touched he at he convenience
but how could that be? he argue
no one be master in panama but himself and he have just kill a man to prove he
under the batter of he argument the power of ysobel wane and slowly disappear
he would go back to the palace
he would force he as he have promise
this woman have be treat with too much consideration
he do not realize the significance of slavery nor do he know the iron of henry morgan
<p>
he turn about and walk back toward the palace
in the hall of audience he throw off he pistol but the grey rapier remain at he side
<p>
ysobel be kneel before a holy picture in he little whitewash cell when henry morgan burst upon he
the dry duenna shrink into a corner at the sight of he but ysobel regard he intently noted he flush face he half-closed fierce eyes
he hear he heavy breathing and with a smile of comprehension rose to he foot
he laughter ring banteringly as he draw a pin from he bodice and assumed the position of a fencer one foot forward he left arm hold behind he for balance the pin pointed before he like a foil
<p>
"en garde ! " he cry
then the captain rush at he
he arms encircle he shoulder and he hands be tearing at he clothing
ysobel stand quite still but one hand dart about with he pin-striking striking-like a small white serpent
little spot of blood appear on henry cheek on he throat
<p>
"your eyes next captain " he say quietly and stab he thrice on the cheekbone
henry release he and step away wipe he bloody face with the back of he hand
ysobel laugh at he
a man may beat-may subject to every violation-a woman who cry and run away but he be helpless before one who stand he ground and only laugh
<p>
"i hear a shot " he say
"i think perhaps he have kill some one to justify he manhood
but he manhood will suffer now will he not?
word of this encounter will get about somehow ; he know how such thing travel
he will be tell that he be beat with a pin in the hands of a woman "
he tone be gloat and cruel
<p>
henry hand slip to he side and the lean rapier creep from he sheath like a freeze serpent
the light lick viciously along he lank blade
at last the needle point came out and the steel turn and pointed at the woman breast
<p>
ysobel grow sick with terror
"i be a sinner " he say
then a dawn relief came into he face
he motion the aged duenna to he and spoke in rapid clatter spanish
<p>
"it be true " say the old woman
"it be true "
<p>
at the end of he speaking ysobel thriftily draw aside the webby lace of he mantilla that he might not be spotted with blood
the duenna begin interpret
<p>
"sir he mistress say that a true catholic who die at the hand of an infidel go to heaven
this be true
further he say that a catholic woman who die protect he holy marriage vow go straightway to heaven
this also be true
lastly he think that such a woman might in course of time be canonize
such thing have happen
ah sir !
captain be kind !
permit he to kiss he hand now before he strike
what grace to have kiss the hand of a living saint !
he may do much for he own sinful soul "
<p>
ysobel spoke to he again
<p>
"my mistress bid he strike ; more he urge he plead for the blow
the angel be hover about he head
he see the great light and the holy music be sounding in he ear "
<p>
the rapier point lower
henry morgan turn away and gaze out into the sunlit garden
little chico came galloping along the path and sit down in the open doorway
the little beast clasp he paw and raise them above he head as though in prayer
the lean rapier make a sharp swish sound as he drive into he scabbard
and captain morgan stoop to pick up the tiny monkey
he walk away stroke chico head with he forefinger
<p>
1 4 5 v
henry morgan lift a golden cup from the heap of loot
he be a lovely slender chalice with long curve handle and a rim of silver
around he outer edge four grotesque lamb chase each other and inside on the bottom a naked girl lift he arms in sensual ecstasy
the captain turn the cup in he hands
then suddenly he hurl he at a little fiery pyramid of diamond
the stone scatter from he neat pile with a dry rustle sound
henry morgan turn and go back to he serpent chair
he be thinking of the little cockney jones ; thinking of the cold hand of epilepsy which have seize he in he last moment of life
the hand have be always behind he a giant hand to wring the man body until the white drops of agony ooze from he lip
henry wonder now why he have want to hurt the little man to torture he and finally to kill he
jones have be shadow through all he life by a sleepless tormentor
of course this murder have be cause by the word of coeur de gris who have say that jones be like henry morgan
yes he know he now and he know also a red shame for he trump charge of thievery
why could he not have kill the man without explanation?
<p>
and coeur de gris-where be he now?
he have see ysobel-that be fairly sure and he have notice he
perhaps he love coeur de gris with he bright hair and he curious way with woman
and how could he keep this young man from knowing he defeat from hearing the adventure of the pin and all the ignominy of henry morgan's dealings with la santa roja?
the pistol which have kill jones be lie on the floor
henry pick he up and methodically go to loading he
he do not fear ridicule from coeur de gris but rather sympathy and understanding
henry do not want understanding now
he lieutenant would look at he with compassion and some pity ; and there would be something superior about the pity something faintly ironic
he would be the pity of a young handsome man who condone the amorous failure of one not so handsome
and then coeur de gris be something like a woman for knowing thing-something like ysobel
he gather information with a mysterious hide eye
<p>
and the red saint
henry musth take he away with he of course
he could do nothing else
perhaps after a long time he would fall in love with he but not surely because of merits in himself
he contempt have convince he that he have no merits ; that he be a monstrous be set apart from other man by unmentionable ugliness
he have not say so much but he have intimate he
no he have not the quality like to draw a woman to he side when there be other man about
but perhaps if he saw no other man he might ignore the quality so lack in he
he might come at last to build on something he possessed
<p>
he think of the last scene with he
now that he be calm he wild action seem the showing off of a thick-legged little boy
but how could any man have done otherwise?
he have beat assault with laughter-sharp cruel laughter which take he motive out and make sport of them
he might have kill he ; but what man could kill a woman who want to be kill who beg to be killed?
the thing be impossible
he ram a bullet into the muzzle of he pistol
<p>
a draggle unkempt figure came through the doorway
he be coeur de gris a red-eyed mud-spatter coeur de gris with the blood of the battle still on he face
he look at the heap of treasure
<p>
"we be rich " he say without enthusiasm
<p>
"where have he be coeur de gris?"
<p>
"been?
'why i have be drunk
he be good to be drunk after fight "
he smile wryly and lick he lip "it be not so good to stop be drunk
that be like childbirth-necessary but unpleasant and unornamental "
<p>
"i want he by he side " say henry morgan
<p>
"you want me?
i be informed that he want no one-that he be quite complete and happy in himself-and so i get a little drunk
he see sir i do not want to remember he reason for be alone "
he pause
"it be tell he sir that the red saint be here "
coeur de gris laugh at he own ill-conceal emotion
he change he manner with an effort of will
he tone become jocular
<p>
"tell he the truth sir
he be a small gift to a man to know what he have miss
many people have no other gift during he whole live
tell he sir have the sweet enemy fallen?
have the castle of flesh capitulated?
do the standard of morgan float over the pink tower?"
<p>
henry face have flush
the pistol in he hand rose quietly steady by an inexorable madness
there be a sharp crash and a white billow of smoke
<p>
coeur de otis stand as he be
he seem to be intently listen to some distant throb sound
then a grimace of terror spread on he face
he finger frantically explore he breast and follow a trickle of blood to he source a small hole in he lung
the little finger edge into the hole
coeur de gris smile again
he be not afraid of certain thing
now that he know he be not frighten any more
<p>
captain morgan stare stupidly at the pistol in he hand
<p>
he seem surprise to discover he there startle at he presence
<p>
coeur de gris laugh hysterically
<p>
"my mother will hate he " he cry ruefully
"she will practice all he ancient curse upon he
he mother he choke over he breath
"do not tell he
make some gleam lie
build he poor life up to a golden minaret
do not let he stop like a half-finished tower
but no-he need build only a foundation
if he give he that he will continue the structure of heroic memory
he will make for he a tomb of white inaccurate thought "
he throat fill with blood
"why do he do he sir?"
<p>
the captain look up from he pistol
<p>
"do it?"
he saw the bloody lip the tear breast ; he start up from he chair and then fell back again
misery be writing lines about he eyes
"i do not know " he say
"i musth have known but i have forget "
<p>
coeur de gris go slowly to he knee
he steady himself with he knuckle on the floor
"it be he knee sir ; he will not bear he any more " he apologize
he seem to be listen for the throb sound again
suddenly he voice rose in bitter complaint
<p>
"it be a legend that dye man think of he deed done
no no-i think of what i have not done-of what i might have done in the year that be dye with he
i think of the lip of woman i have never see-of the wine that be sleep in a grape seed-of the quick warm caress of he mother in goaves
but mostly i think that i shall never walk about again-never never stroll in the sunshine nor smell the rich essence the full moon conjure up out of the earth sir why do he do it?"
<p>
henry morgan be stare at the pistol again
"i do not know " he mutter sullenly
"i musth have known but i have forget
i kill a dog once-and i have just kill jones
i do not know why "
<p>
"you be a great man captain " coeur de gris say bitterly
"great man may leave he reason for the creative band of he apologist
but i-why sir i be nothing any more-nothing
a moment ago i be an excellent swordsman ; but now he be-that which fight and cursed and love-he may never have be for all i know "
he wrist weaken and he fell to he side and lay there cough at the obstruction in he throat
then for a time there be no sound in the room save he uneven gasp for breath
but suddenly he raise himself on one elbow and laugh ; laugh at some cosmic joke some jest of the great rolling sphere ; laugh triumphantly as though he have solve a puzzle and found how simple he be
a wave of blood ride to he lip on the laughter and fill up he throat
the laugh become a gush sigh and coeur de gris sink slowly to he side and be still because he lung would no longer force breath
<p>
henry still stare at the pistol in he hand
slowly he raise he eyes to the open window
the stream ray of the sun make the treasure on the floor glow like a mass of hot metal
he eyes wander to the body in front of he
he shudder
and then he go to coeur de gris pick he up and sit he in a chair
the limp body fell over to one side
henry straighten he and brace he in an upright position
then he go back to he serpent chair
<p>
"i raise he hand like this he say pointing the pistol at coeur de gris
"i raise he hand like this
i musth have
coeur de gris be dead
like this i raise he-like this-and pointed-how do i do it?"
he bow he head then raise he with a chuckle

he be interrupted by a tramp of foot on the stairs
a band of he man enter driving in he midst a poor frighten spaniard-a mud-draggle terrify spaniard
the lace have be tear from he neck and a little stream of blood run from one sleeve
<p>
"here be a spaniard sir " the leader say

<p>
grippo be seat in the middle of the floor sullenly count the buttons on he sleeve
<p>
"-eight nine-there be ten
some bastard have steal he button
ah this world of thieve !
he be too much
i would kill for that button
he be he favourite button
one two three-why there be ten
one two three four about he the dancer rock and the air be reek with the shrill cry of the flute
<p>
captain sawkins glower at the dancer
he firmly believe that to dance be to go to hell by a short route
beside he captain zeigler sadly watch the flow of liquor
this zeigler be call the tavern keeper of the sea
he be he practice after a raid to keep the man at sea until he have spend he plunder buy the rummy which he supply
once he have a mutiny he be say because for three month he sail around and around one island
he could not help he
the man still have money and he still have rummy
this night he be sadden by these barrel of liquor which be be drunk without any obbligato of coin ring on the counter
he be unnatural to he and mischievous
<p>
henry morgan be sitting alone in the hall of audience
he could barely hear the crying music of the dance
throughout the day little band of man have come in bearing bit of belated treasure dig from the earth or drawn with iron hook from the cistern
one old woman have swallow a diamond to save he but the searcher dig for that too and found he
<p>
now a grey twilight be in the hall of audience
all through the day henry morgan have be sitting in he tall chair and the day have change he
he eyes those peer eyes which have look out over a living horizon be turn inward
he have be look at himself look perplexedly at henry morgan
in the year of he life and of he adventure he have believe so completely in he purpose whatever he may have be at the moment that he have give the matter little think
but today he have considered himself and in the grey twilight he be bewilder at the sight of henry morgan
henry morgan do not seem worthy or even important
those desire and ambition toward which he have bay across the world like a scent hound be shabby thing now he look inward at himself
and wonderment like the twilight be about he in the hall of audience
<p>
as he sit in the half dark the wrinkle duenna creep in and stand before he
he voice be like the crumple of paper
<p>
"my lady wish to speak with he " he say
<p>
henry rose and walk heavily after he toward the cell
a candle be burning before the holy picture on the wall
the madonna re-present be a fat spanish peasant holding a flabby child at which he look with sad astonishment
the priest who paint he mean to put reverence on he face but he have so little experience with reverence
he have be successful however in making he a good portrait of he dull mistress and he child
four reales the picture bring he
<p>
ysobel sit under the picture
when henry enter he go quickly to he
<p>
"it be say i be to be ransom "
<p>
"your husband send a messenger "
<p>
"my husband !

<p>
"yes "
<p>
he pointed to a chair and forced henry to seat himself
"you do not understand he " he say
"you could not understand he
he musth know something of the life i have travel
i musth tell he this thing and then he will understand he and then
he await he interest
henry be silent
<p>
"don't he wish to hear this thing?" he ask
<p>
"yes "
<p>
"well he be short
he life have be short
but i want he to understand he and then
he look sharply into he face
henry mouth be pinch as though in pain
he eyes contemplate bewilderment
he make no reply to he pause
<p>
"it be this way he see " he begin
"i be born here in panama but he parent send he to spain when i be a small child
i live in a convent in cordova
i wear grey diving and lay in watch before the virgin on he nights give to adoration
sometimes i go to sleep when i should have be pray
i have suffer for that laxness
when i have be there a number of year the bravo raid he father plantation here in panama and kill all of he family
i be left with no relative save one old grandfather
i be alone and i be sad
i do not sleep on the floor before the virgin for a time
<p>
"i have grown handsome that i know for once a cardinal who be visit the school look at he and he lip tremble and the great vein stand out on he hands when i kiss he ring
he say 'peace be with he he daughter
have he anything he would like to confess to he privately?'
<p>
"i hear the cry of the water seller over the wall and i hear the scuffle of a quarrel
once two man fight with sword in sight of he where i stand on a stick and look over the wall
and one night a young man bring a girl to the shadow of the gate and lay with he there within two pace of he
i hear them whisper together he protest he fear and he reassure he
i fingered he grey gown and wonder whether this boy would plead with he if he know he
when i spoke to one of the sister about this night he say 'it be wicked to hear such thing and more wicked to think of them
he musth do penance for he curious ear
what gate do he say?'
<p>
"the fishmonger would cry 'come little grey angel and look on he basket of catch
come out of he holy prison little grey angel '
<p>
"one night i climb over the wall and go away from the city
i do not mean to tell he of he journey but only of the day when i came to paris
the kingbolt be riding through the street and he equipage be glitter and gold
i stand high on he toe in the crowd of people and watch the courtier go riding by
then suddenly a dark face be thrust before he and a strong hand take he arm
i be lead to a doorway apart from the people
<p>
"see captain ; he whip he with a thong of hard leather he have only for that purpose
he face have something of a beast snarl hiding very near the surface
but he be free-a bold free thief
he kill before he stole always he kill
and he live in entryways and on the floor of church and under the land arch of a bridge and he be free-free from thought and free from fear and worry
but once he go away from he and i found he hanging by the neck on a gallows-oh a great gallows festoon with man hanging by he neck
<p>
"can he understand that captain?
do he see that as i saw it?
and do he mean anything at all to you?"
he eyes be on fire
<p>
"i walk back to cordova and he foot be tear
i do penance until he body be tear but i could not drive out all the devil
i be exorcise but the devil be deep in he
can he understand that captain?"
he look into henry face and saw that he have not be listen
he stand beside he and move he finger in he grey hair
<p>
"you be change " he say
"some light be go out of he
what fear have fall on you?"
<p>
he stir from he reverie
<p>
"i do not know "
<p>
"i be tell that he kill he friend
be he that which burden you?"
<p>
"i kill he "
<p>
"and do he mourn for him?"
<p>
"perhaps
i do not know
i think i mourn for some other thing which be dead
he might have be a vital half of he which dye leave he half a man
today i have be like a bound slave on a white slab of marble with the gather vivisector about he
i be supposed to be a healthy slave but the scalpel found he sick with a disease call mediocrity "
<p>
"i be sorry " he say
<p>
"you be sorry?
why be he sorry?"
<p>
"i think i be sorry because of he lose light because the brave brutal child in he be dead-the boastful child who mock and think he mockery shake the throne of god ; the confident child who graciously permit the world to accompany he through space
this child be dead and i be sorry
i would go with he now if i think he possible to warm the child to life again "
<p>
henry say "it be strange
two days ago i plan to tear a continent out of the set order and crown he with a capital of gold for he
in he mind i build up an empire for he and plan the diadem he should wear
and now i dimly remember the person who think these thing
he be an enigmatic stranger on a stagger globe
<p>
"and he-i feel only a slight uneasiness with he
i be not afraid of he any more
i do not want he any more
i be fill with a nostalgia for he own black mountain and for the speech of he own people
i be drawn to sit in a deep veranda and to hear the talk of an old man i used to know
i find i be tire of all this bloodshed and struggle for thing that will not lie still for article that will not retain he value in he hands he be horrible " he cry
"i do not want anything any more
i have no lust and he desire be dry and rattle
i have only a vague wish for peace and the time to ponder imponderable matter "
<p>
"you will take no more cup of gold " he say
"you will turn no more vain dream into unsatisfactory conquest
i be sorry for he captain morgan
and he be not right about the slave
ill he be indeed but not with the illness he have mention
but i suppose he sin be great
all man who break the bar of mediocrity commit frightful sin
i shall pray for he to the holy virgin and he will intercede for he at the throne of heaven
but what be i to do?"
<p>
"you will go back to he husband i suppose "
<p>
"yes i will go back
he have make he old seor
he have prick the dream on which he heavy spirit float
and i wonder whether in the year to come he will blame he for the death of he friend "
<p>
henry flush quickly
<p>
"i be trying to do something of that sort now " he say
"it do not seem worth the while to lie any more and that be only one more proof of dead youth
but now good-by ysobel
i wish i love he now as i think i do yesterday
go back to he husband scent hands "
<p>
he smile and raise he eyes to the holy picture on the wall
"peace go with he dear fool " he murmur
"ah i too have lose he youth
i be old old-for i can console himself with the think of what he have miss "
<p>
1 4 7 vii
henry morgan stand in the doorway of the hall of audience and watch a little troupe of spaniards ride through the street toward the palace
the troupe be surround on all side by a mob of buccaneer
first in the line came the messenger but a change messenger
now he be dress in scarlet silk
the plume of he hat and he sword scabbard be white in token of peace
behind he ride six soldier in silver breast-plate and the spanish helmet which look like half mustard seed
the last soldier lead a riderless white mare with crimson trappings and a line of golden bell on he brow band
the white saddle cloth nearly touched the ground
following the mare be six mule bearing heavy leathern bags and the group be rear-guarded by six more soldier
<p>
the cavalcade draw up before the palace
the messenger leap from he horse and bow to henry morgan
<p>
"i have here the ransom " he say
he look worry and tire
the weight of he mission be riding heavily on he spirit
at he command the soldier carry the leather bags into the hall of audience and only when he be all deposit with the rest of the treasure do the anxiety leave he face
<p>
"ah " he say "it be good
he be the treasure
twenty thousand piece of eight-not one lose by the wayside
i invite he to count them seor "
he whip a little dust from he foot
"if he man could have refreshment seor ; wine he suggest
<p>
"yes
yes "
henry motion to one of he follower
"see that these man have food and drink
be courteous as he love life "
<p>
then he go to the bags to count the ransom
he make little tower of shine coin and move the tower about on the floor
money be bright he think
he could have be cut in no more charming shape either
a square would not answer nor an ellipse
and money be really worth more than money
he tumble a tower and build he up again
he be so extremely certain-money
one know beforehand what he would do if set in motion ; at least he know up to a certain point
beyond that point he do not matter what he accomplished
one might buy wine with money
one have the wine
and if the merchant clerk should kill he master for the same coin he be unfortunate ; he be perhaps fate or something like that but one have he wine just the same
<p>
and all this pile of golden vessel these crosslet and candlestick and pearl vestment would be money like this
these bar of gold and silver would be cut into round flake and each flake stamp with a picture
the picture would be more than a picture
like the kiss of a saint he would endow the flake with power ; the picture would give he a character and a curious compelling soul
he fling the coin into a heap and patiently set about to rebuild them
enough tower for jerusalem !
<p>
now ysobel came from the patio and stand beside he
<p>
"what an amount of money " he say
"is that he ransom?"
<p>
"yes ; he be the gold which purchase he "
<p>
"but what a very great deal !
be i worth that much do he think?"
<p>
"to he husband he be
he pay he for he "
he move ten tower into a line
<p>
"and to he-how much?
how many of these golden chips?"
<p>
"you musth have be worth that much to he
i stated the price "
<p>
"wouldn't he skip well on the water ! " he say
"how he would skip !
do he know i can throw like a boy with he arm bent "
<p>
"it be say he be capable " he announce
<p>
"but be i really worth that much?"
<p>
"the money be here and he be to go
he have buy he
a thing musth be worth what be pay for he or there could be no trade "
<p>
"it be good " he say
"it be comforting to know one value to a real
have he any idea of he worth captain?"
<p>
henry morgan say "if i be ever capture and a ransom demand for he i would not be worth a copper penny
these dog of mine would laugh and shrug
a new captain would raise to lead them and i-well i would be subject to the pleasure of he captor and i think i could foretell he pleasure
he see i have be at revalue himself in the last few days
i may have some value to historian because i have destroy a few thing
the builder of he cathedral be forget even now but i who burned he may be remember for a hundred year or so
and that may mean something or other about mankind "
<p>
"but what be there about he that be worth all this gold?" he insist
"is he he arms do he suppose?
he hair?
or be he that i be the embodiment of he husband vanity?"
<p>
"i do not know " say henry
"with the revaluation of himself the whole economic system of emotion and person have change
today be i to demand a ransom perhaps he would not be flatter "
<p>
"do he so hate he captain morgan?"
<p>
"no i do not hate he ; but he be one of the star of he firmament which have prove to be a meteor "
<p>
"that be not gallant sir
that be quite different from he speech of a few days past " he observe spitefully
<p>
"no
he be not gallant
i think that hereafter i shall be gallant for two reason only-money and advancement
i try to be gallant for the pure joyous look of thing
he see i be honest with himself before and i be honest with himself now
these two honesty be antithetical "
<p>
"you be bitter "
<p>
"no ; i be not even bitter
the food that bitterness feed on be go out of he "
<p>
"i be going now " he say softly and wistfully
"have he nothing more to say to he about myself?
nothing more to ask of me?"
<p>
"nothing " he answer and immediately go to piling the coin again
<p>
the messenger enter from the street
he have drunk deeply for the removed burden of he mission have make he joyous
he bow to ysobel and to henry morgan ; bow warily with an eye to he balance
<p>
"we musth go seor " he announce loudly
"the way be long "
he lead ysobel to the white mare and help he into the saddle
then at he signal the column move off down the street
ysobel look back once as he start and he seem that he have take a mood from henry morgan for there be a puzzle smile on he lip
but then he bent he head over the mare neck ; he be intently study the mare white mane
<p>
the messenger have remain standing at henry side in the doorway
together he watch the fluid line of rider swing away while the sunlight glint on the soldier armour
in the center of the troupe the white mare seem a pearl in a setting of silver
<p>
the messenger put he hand on henry shoulder
<p>
"we know how to understand each other he man of responsibility " he say drunkenly
"it be not as though he be child to have secret
he be man brave man and strong
he may confide in each other
he may tell he the thing near he heart if he wish seor "
<p>
henry shake the hand from he shoulder
"i have nothing to tell he " he say brusquely
<p>
"ah ; but then i will tell he something
perhaps he wonder why the husband of this woman be will to pay such a vast sum for he
he be only a woman he say
there be many woman to be have more cheaply-some for a real or two
he husband be a fool he say
but i would not have he think that of he master
he be no fool
i will tell he how he be
he grandfather still live and he be the owner of ten silver mine and fifty league of fertile land in peru
doa ysobel be the heiress
now if he be kill or carry off-but he understand seor-poof !
the fortune into the kingbolt arms ! "
he laugh at the cleverness of he reasoning
"we understand each other seor
he have tough skull-not the soft heads of chicken
twenty thousand-he be nothing to be reckon against ten silver mine
ah yes ; he understand each other he man of responsibility "
<p>
he clamber into he saddle and ride away still laugh
henry morgan saw he join the undulate cavalcade ; and now there be a ruby with the pearl in the silver setting
<p>
captain morgan go back to the treasure
he sit on the floor and take the coin into he hands
"the most human of all human trait be inconsistency " he think "it be a shock to learn this thing almost as great a shock to a man as the realization of he humanity
and why musth he learn that last?
in all the mad incongruity the turgid stultiloquy of life i feel at least securely anchor to himself
whatever the vacillation of other people i think himself terrifically constant
but now here i be drag a fray line and he anchor go
i do not know whether the rope be cut or merely wear away but he anchor be go
and i be sailing around and around an island in which there be no iron "
he let the gold piece slip through he finger
"but perhaps here be he iron for the making of a new anchor " he think
"this be hard and heavy
he value may fluctuate somewhat in the economic current but at least he have a purpose and only one purpose
he be an absolute assurance of security
yes perhaps this be the one true anchor ; the one thing a man may be utterly sure of
he claw hook tightly to comfort and security
strangely i have a crave for them both "
<p>
"but other man have a share in this gold " part of he brain argue
<p>
"no he dear conscience ; he have an end of acting now
i have put on new glasses ; rather he have be lock about he head and i musth order he life in accordance with the world i see through these new lens
i see that honesty-public honesty-may be a ladder to a high more valuable crime ; veracity a means to more subtle dissimulation
no ; these man have no right he can enforce
these man be too free with the right of other to deserve consideration "
he stumble happily on the think
"they steal and so shall he plunder be steal
<p>
"but i say i be finished with evasion and conscience drug
what have i to do with right now-or reason or logic or conscience?
i want this money
i want security and comfort and i have the power between he hands to take both
he may not be the ideal of youth but i think he have be the world practice from the beginning
luckily perhaps the world be not operate by youth
and besides " he say "these fool of man do not deserve any of he
he would be throw he away in the brothel when he came home again "
<p>

<p>
then there be curse and violence on the beach

he plan the horror of the retribution
and he scatter
some starve ; some be torture by the indians
the spaniards catch and strangle some of them and england virtuously hang a few

a multifarious population be crowded on the beach at port royal
he have come to see the captain morgan who have plunder panama
great ladies dress in the silken stuff of china be there because after all henry morgan came of a good family-the nephew of the poor dear lieutenant governor who be kill
sailor be there because he be a sailor ; little boy because he be a pirate ; young girl because he be a hero ; business man because he be rich ; gangue of slave because he have a holiday
there be prostitute with berry juice squeeze on he lip and with restless eyes searching the face of unaccompanied man ; and there be girl child who hearts mother the sacred little hope that the great man might just possibly look in he direction and find the understanding he musth crave
<p>
in the crowd be sailor who pride lay in the fact that he have hear captain morgan curse ; tailor who have fitted breeches to he leg
each man who have see henry morgan and have hear he speak collected a group of admirer
these lucky one have take a bit of greatness from the contact
<p>
the negro slave free from he field work on this day of interest and rejoice gaze with huge vacuous eyes at the galleon riding in the harbour
plantation owner stride about amongst the people talk loudly of what he would say to henry morgan when he have he out to dinner and what he would advise he
he spoke lightly and carelessly of he as though he be he constant practice to entertain plunderer of panama
certain tavern keeper have broach cask of wine on the beach from which he give freely to all who ask
he gain would come later with the thirst he only whet
<p>
on a small pier wait the party of the governor ; handsome young man in lace and silver buckle with a squad of pikeman to give them an official appearance
the sea fan delicate unbreaking wave on the beach
he be late morning and the sun a glaring crucible in the sky but no one feel the heat ; the people have eyes and feeling for nothing but the tall galleon riding in the harbour
<p>
noon have come when henry morgan who have be watch the beach through a glass decided to enter the city
he stage-craft be not merely vanity
in the night a small boat have come alongside with the news that he might be arrest for fight the enemy of the kingbolt
henry think the approval of the people would weigh in he favour
all morning he have watch the approval grow as the crowd become more and more excited
<p>
but now he long boat be lower and the sailor take he place
as he approach the shore the gather mob break into yell and then a concerted roaring cheer
the people throw he hat leap dance grimace try to shriek conversation at one another
at the pier hands be extended to grasp henry before he be out of the boat
and immediately he have step up the pikeman form about the official party and with weapon lower forced a rough passage amongst the fight crane spectator
<p>
henry glance with apprehension at the soldier who surround he
"am i under arrest?" he ask of the cavalier who walk beside he
<p>
"under arrest ! "
the man laugh
"no !
he could arrest he if he would
the mob would tear he to piece
and if he do succeed in the arrest he would rip out the stone of the jail with he finger to free he
he do not realize what he be to these people sir
for days he have talk of nothing save he coming
but the governor want to see he immediately sir
he could come here himself for obvious reason "
<p>
he arrive at the mansion of the governor
<p>
"captain morgan " say governor moddyford when he be alone "i do know whether he news be good or bad
word of he conquest have come to the ear of the kingbolt
both of he be order to england "
<p>
"but i have a commission henry begin
<p>
the fat head and shoulder of the governor shake a sad negative
"now i would mention the commission captain if i be he even though i himself do issue he
there be clause in he commission which might get he both criticize
as he be he may be hang : but i do know-i do know
of course there be peace between spain and england-but no good feeling none at all
the kingbolt be angry with he but i think a few thousand pound distribute in the right quarters might placate he be he mad with rage
the english people be fill with joy over the conquest
do worry about he captain ; certainly i do not "
he look keenly into henry eyes
"i hope sir that he can spare those few thousand when the time come "
<p>
say henry officially "i have try to serve the spirit of he sovereign wish not the outward play of he politics "
and then "surely sir charles ; i have enough to buy the kingbolt favour though he cost half a million
he say the kingbolt be a good man and a judge of fine woman and i never know one such not to need money "
<p>
"there be another thing captain " say the governor uneasily
"your uncle be kill some time ago
he daughter be here in he house
sir edward be nearly penniless when he die
of course he understand he would like to have he stay here with he always but i do not think he be quite happy
i think he chafe under what he think be charity
he will look to he welfare of course
sir edward die nobly and be commend by the kingbolt but after all the commendation of the crown can be spend "
<p>
henry smile
"my uncle would have die nobly
i be sure this uncle of mine make every move in he life-yes even to the paring of he nail-as though the complete peerage be look on ready to make critical comment
<p>
how do he die?
making a short fitting oration?
or with the damned thin lip of he press together as though he disapprove of death for social reasons?
ah that man !
he life be a fine simple part and he be very true to he "
henry spoke laughingly
"i hate he uncle
i think he frighten he
he be one of the few people i fear
but tell he how he die "
<p>
"it be whisper that he groan once
i trace the rumour and found that some servant have be hiding behind a curtain
he doubtless tell of he "
<p>
"too bad !
too bad !
what a cruel shame he be to ruin a perfect life with an exhalation
but now i be not afraid of he any more
if he groan there be humanity in he and weakness
i despise he but i love he for he
as to he cousin i shall take he off he hands he may be sure
i dimly remember he as a tall little girl with yellow hair-a little girl who play abominably on the harp ; at least he sound abominable to he though he may have be quite good "
<p>
moddyford came to a subject he have be wanting to broach
<p>
"i have hear that he meet the red saint in panama and release he for a ransom
how do that happen?
he be say to be the pearl of the earth "
<p>
henry redden
<p>
"oh well " he say "it seem to he that the legend flatter he
he be nice look surely ; and i do say some man would not have be strike with he
but he be not the kind of woman i admire for himself
he be rather free in he speech he know-spoke of thing unfeminine in he opinion
besides he ride horse astride and fence
in short he be without that modesty he have come to look for in well-bred woman "
<p>
"but as a mistress surely as a mistress?"
<p>
"well he see i receive seventy-five thousand piece of eight for he
to he mind that be worth more than any woman who be ever born "
<p>
"that much ransom?
how do he happen to bring so much?"
<p>
"why on investigation i found that he be an heiress
and as i say he be nice look but still-the legend flatter he "
<p>
meanwhile in another room lady moddyford be earnestly talk to elizabeth
<p>
"i find i musth speak to he as a mother he dear a mother who be look to he future
there be absolutely no doubt that he cousin will look out for he ; but would he be happy that way?-just hanging to he purse string i mean?
look at he in another light
he be rich well-favour
he understand he dear that he be impossible to be delicate about this and i do not know that he would be desirable even if he be possible
why do he marry he cousin?
if nothing else came of he he would be the one woman on earth who could not criticize he husband relative "
<p>
"but what be he suggest lady moddyford?"
elizabeth put in meekly
"isn't he some kind of crime to marry one cousin?"
<p>
"not a bit of he he dear
there be nothing in church or state to forbid he and i himself would favour such a marriage
sir charles and he cousin have be order to england
sir charles think a knighthood might be arrange
then he would be lady morgan and he would be rich "
<p>
elizabeth muse : "i only saw he once for a moment and then i do think i quite like he
he be excited and red
but he be very respectful and gentle
i think he want to be friend with he but he father-he know how papa be
perhaps he would make a good husband " he say
<p>
"my dear any man make a good husband if he be properly look after "
<p>
"yes he might be the good way out
i be tire of be pity for he poverty
but with this new popularity do he think he would notice me?
he might be too proud to marry a penniless cousin "
<p>
"dear elizabeth " lady moddyford say firmly "don't he know by now that almost any woman can marry almost any man as long as some other woman do interfere?
and i shall arrange matter so that no one will get in he way
he may trust he for that "
<p>
elizabeth have make up he mind
"i know ; i shall play for he
i have hear how music affect these fierce man
i shall play he he new piece elf concourse ' and 'god bear the weary soul to rest '
"
"no " break in lady moddyford
"no i would do that if i be he
he might not like fine music
there be good way "
<p>
"but he say those piece be very pretty ; he say he himself
and have i read how music soothe man until he can hardly bear it?"
<p>
"very well he dear ; play for he then if he will
perhaps he-but play for he
such thing may run in the family-the love of music i mean
of course he know he musth admire he and at the same time be a little afraid of he
make he feel that he be a poor helpless little creature completely hem in with tiger
but he musth arrange he in he own way
he have a good start for he may appeal to he for protection from the beginning "
he sigh "i do know what he should do without protection
i do know when sir charles would have propose to he
the dear be frighten out of he life to begin
one afternoon he sit on a bench and i positively search the landscape for something to frighten he
he musth have be there three hours before a little water-snake amble along the path and terrify he into he arms
no i can think what he should do without protection
sir charles have a man in the garden all the time look for snake
and do he know i have always like snake
i have three of them for pet when i be a little girl "
<p>
the next morning lady moddyford bring them together and as soon as he gracefully could left them alone
<p>
elizabeth look fearfully at he cousin
<p>
"you have done great terrible thing on the ocean captain morgan-enough to freeze one thinking about them " he say falteringly
<p>
"the deed be not great nor very dreadful
nothing be as good or as bad as the telling of he "
<p>
and he think "i be wrong about he-very wrong
he be not supercilious at all
he musth have be he father-the devil-who give he a wrong impression of he
he be quite nice "
<p>
"i be sure he be great if he modesty would let he admit he " he be saying demurely
"do he know i used to tremble at the tales he tell of he and hope that he be not in need or trouble "
<p>
"did you?
why do you?
i do think he ever notice he "
<p>
he eyes have fill with tears
"i have have trouble too "
<p>
"i know
he tell he about he trouble and i be sorry for he little cousin elizabeth
i hope he will let he help he in he trouble
will he sit here beside he elizabeth?"
<p>
he look shyly at he
"i'll play for he if he like " he say
<p>
"ye-es-yes do "
<p>
"now this be 'the elf concourse '
listen !
he can hear he little foot patter on the grass
everybody say he be very sweet and pretty "
he finger methodically worked at the string
<p>
henry think he hands lovely as he fly about
he forget about the music in watch he hands
he be like little white moth so delicate and restless
one would hesitate in touching them because handling might ruin them and yet one want to stroke them
the piece be ending with loud bass notes
now he be finished
when the last string have cease he vibration he observe :
"you play very-precisely elizabeth "
<p>
"oh i play the notes as he come " he say
"i always think the composer know he business good than i do "
<p>
"i know and he be a comfort to hear he
he be nice to know that everything be to be in he place-even notes
he have eradicate a certain obnoxious freedom i have notice in the play of some young woman
that kind be very lovable and spontaneous and human of course but give to carelessness in the interest of passion
yes as i become old i grow to be taking satisfaction in seeing the thing i expect come about
unsure thing be distracting
chance have not the tug on he he once have
i be a fool elizabeth
i go sailing and sailing look for something-well something that do not exist perhaps
and now that i have lose he unnamable desire i may not be happy but there be more content on he "
<p>
"that sound wise and worldly and a little bit cynical " he observe
<p>
"but if he be wisdom then wisdom be experience beating about in an orderly brain kick over the file
and how could i be otherwise than worldly
and cynicism be the moss which collect on a rolling stone "
<p>
"that be clever anyway " he agreed
"i suppose he have known a great many of those young woman he spoke of "
<p>
"what young woman elizabeth?"
<p>
"the one who play badly "
<p>
"oh !
yes i have meet a few "
<p>
"and do he-do he-like them?"
<p>
"i tolerate them because he be friend of he friend "
<p>
"did any of them fall in love with you?
i know i be not delicate but he be he cousin and almost he-he brother "
<p>
"oh some say he do-but i suspect he want he money "
<p>
"surely not !
but i shall play for he again
this will be a sad piece bear the weary soul to rest '
i always think he be good to have seriousness with the lighter music "
<p>
"yes " he say
"yes ; so he be "
<p>
again he finger worked over the string
<p>
"it be very beautiful and sad " say henry when he be finished
"i like he wonderfully well but do he think elizabeth-do he think that sixth string from the end might be a little
<p>
"oh i would have he touched for the world ! " he cry
"before he came out from england papa have a man-a harp man-go over the whole thing thoroughly
i would feel just right with papa if he be tamper with
he hate people who fiddle with thing "
<p>
he sit silently after he outburst but at length he look pleadingly into he eyes
"you be angry with he about the string be he cousin henry?
i just have deep feeling like that
i can help he "
<p>
"no of course i be not angry "
he be so little and so helpless he think
<p>
"where will he be going now that he be rich and famous and cover with honors?"
<p>
"i do know
i want to live in an atmosphere of sure thing "
<p>
"why that's just the way i think " he exclaim
"we musth be somewhat alike
thing come to he if he do not go look for them i say
and nearly always i know what be going to happen to he because i hope for he and then sit still "
<p>
"yes " say henry
<p>
"papa's death be a great shock " he say and again the tears be in he eyes
"it's a terrible thing to be left alone and nearly no-no relative or friend
of course the moddyfords have be lovely to he but he could be like he own people
oh dear !
i have be so lonely
i be glad when he came cousin henry if only because he be of one blood "
he eyes be glisten with tears and he underlip tremble violently
<p>
"but he musth not cry " henry say soothingly
"you will not need to worry any more elizabeth
i be here to take he trouble from he shoulder
i will help he and care for he elizabeth
i wonder how he bore the grief that fell on he
he have be brave to hold he head so high when misery be tug at he spirit "
<p>
"i have he music " he say
"i could retire into he music when the grief be too bitter "
<p>
"but now elizabeth he need not even do that
he will come with he to england when i go and he will be comfortable and safe with he for always "
<p>
he have spring away from he
<p>
"but what be he suggesting?
what be this thing he be propose to me?" he cry
"isn't he some sin-some crime-for cousin to marry?"
<p>
"marry?"
<p>
"oh ! "
he blush and he eyes glitter again with he quick tears
"oh !
i be ashamed
he do mean marry do you?
i be ashamed "
he agitation be pitiful
<p>
"after all why not?" think henry
"she be pretty ; i be sure of he family ; and besides he be rather a symbol of this security i have be preach
i could be sure of never doing anything very radical if he be he wife
i really think i do want security
and besides " he think finished "i really can let he suffer so "
<p>
"oh surely i mean marry
what else could he have think i meant?
i be only clumsy and crude about he
i have startle he and hurt he
but dear elizabeth there be no crime or sin about he
many cousin marry
and he know all about each other and he family be one
he musth marry he elizabeth
truly i love he elizabeth "
<p>
"oh ! " he stammer
"o-oh !
i can think of he
i mean i be-ill ; i mean he head whirl
he act so suddenly henry-so unexpectedly
oh please let he go
i musth talk about he to lady moddyford
he will know what to say "
<p>
1 5 2 ii
kingbolt charles the second and john evelyn be sitting in a tiny library
a bright fire crackle on the hearth throw he flickerings on the book which line the wall
on a table beside the two man be bottle and glasses
<p>
"i knight he this afternoon " the kingbolt be saying
"he get pardon and a knighthood for two thousand pound "
<p>
"well two thousand pound murmur john evelyn
"certain tradesman will perhaps bless he knighthood "
<p>
"but that's not he john
i could have get twenty
he take about a million out of panama "
<p>
"ah well ; two thousand pound
"i order he to come in here tonight " say the kingbolt
"these sailor and pirate sometimes have a tale or two worth repeat
you'll be disappointed in he
he be-lumpish i think be the word
he get the impression that a great mass be plant before he ; and he move as though he pushed this own invisible cage ahead of he "
<p>
"you might create a title " john evelyn suggest
"it seem wasteful to let a million get away without even trying "
<p>
sir henry morgan be announce
<p>
"step in sir
step in ! "
the kingbolt saw that he have a glass of wine in he hands
henry seem frighten
he gulp the wine
<p>
"good job of he in panama " the kingbolt observe
"it be good to burn he now than later and i have no doubt he should have have to do he later "
<p>
"i think of that when i set the torch sire
these hoggish spaniards want to overrun the world "
<p>
"you know captain piracy-or to be delicate free-booting-have be a good thing for he and a bad thing for spain
but the institution grow to be a nuisance
i spend half of he time making excuse to the spanish ambassador
i be going to commission he lieutenant-governor of jamaica "
<p>
"sire ! "
<p>
"no thanks !
i be acting on the advice of an adage
piracy musth be stopped now
these man have play at little war long enough "
<p>
"but sire i himself be a buccaneer
do he want he to hang he own men?"
<p>
"that be what i infer sir
who can track them down good than he who know all he haunts?"
<p>
"they fight with he sire "
<p>
"ah ; conscience?
i have hear that he be able to do about as he please with he conscience "
<p>
"not conscience sire but pity "
<p>
"pity be misplace in a public servant or a robber
a man may do what he be profitable to do
he himself have demonstrate two of these premises
let he see he labor with the third " the kingbolt say acidly
<p>
"i wonder if i can "
<p>
"if he wonder then he can " john evelyn put in
<p>
the kingbolt manner change
<p>
"come ! drink ! " he say
"we musth have life and perhaps later song
tell he a tale captain and drink while he tell he
wine add capital and asterisk to a good tale-a true storey "
<p>
"a tale sire?"
<p>
"surely
some storey of the colonial wench ; some little interlude in piracy-for i be sure he do not steal only gold "
he motion a servant to keep henry glass fill
"i have hear of a certain woman in panama
tell he about he "
<p>
henry drain he glass
he face be becoming flush
"there be a tale about he " he say
"she be pretty but also he be an heiress
i confess i favour he
he would inherit silver mine
he husband offer one hundred thousand piece of eight for he
he want to get he hands on the mine
here be the question sire and i wonder how many man have be confront with one like it?
should i get the woman or the hundred thousand?"
<p>
the kingbolt lean forward in he chair
"which do he take?
tell he quickly "
<p>
"i remain in panama for a while " say henry
"what would he majesty have done in he place?
i get both
perhaps i get even more than that
who know but he son will inherit the silver mine eventually "
<p>
"i would have done that " cry the kingbolt
"you be right
i would have done just that
he be clever sir
a toast captain-to foresight
he generalship sir run to other matter than warfare i see
he have never be defeat in battle he say ; but tell he captain be he ever defeat in love?
he be a good scene-an unusual scene-when a man admit himself best in love
the admission be so utterly contrary to every masculine instinct
another glass sir and tell he about he defeat "
<p>
"not by a woman sire but once i be defeat by death
there be thing which so sere the soul that the pain of he follow through life
he ask for the storey
he health sire
<p>
"i be born in wale amongst the mountain
he father be a gentleman
one summer while i be a lad a little princess of france came to he mountain for the air
he have a small retinue and be lively and restless and clever he achieve some freedom
one morning i came upon he where he bath alone in the river
he be naked and unashamed
in an hour-such be the passionate blood of he race-he be lie in he arms
sire in all he wandering in the lovely woman i have see and the town i have take there have be no pleasure like the days of that joyous summer
when he could escape he play together in the hill like little god
but this be not enough
he want to be married
he would give up he rank and he would go to live somewhere in america
<p>
"then the autumn came
one day he say 'they be ready to take he away but i will not go '
the next day he do not come to he
in the night i go to he window and he throw a little note to he 'i be imprison
he have whip he '
<p>
"i go home
what else could i do?
i could not fight them the stout soldier who guarded he
very late that night there be a pound on the door and cry 'where be a doctor to be had?
quick !
the little princess have poison himself '
"
henry lift he eyes
the kingbolt be smile ironically
john evelyn drum the table with he finger
<p>
"yes?" say the kingbolt
"yes?"
he chuckle
<p>
"ah i be old-old " henry moan
"it be a lie
he be a pleasant child the daughter of a cottager "
<p>
he stagger to he foot and move toward the door
shame be burning in he face
<p>
"captain morgan he forget himself "
<p>
"i-forget
<p>
"there be certain little courtesy
custom demand that he render them to he person "
<p>
"i plead pardon sire
i plead he permission to leave
i-i be ill "
he bow himself from the room
<p>
the kingbolt be smile through he wine
<p>
"how be he john that such a great soldier can be such a great fool?"
<p>
say john evelyn "how could he be otherwise?
if great man be not fool the world would have be destroy long ago
how could he be otherwise?
folly and distorted vision be the foundation of greatness "
<p>
"you mean that he vision be distorted?"
<p>
"no i do not mean that "
<p>
"then he imply
"i wish to go on with henry morgan
he have a knack for piracy which make he great
immediately he imagine he as a great ruler
he make he lieutenant-governor
in this he be like the multitude
he believe that if a man do one thing magnificently he should be able to do all thing equally well
if a man be eminently successful in create an endless line of mechanical doodah of some excellence he conceive he capable of leading army or maintain government
he think that because he be a good kingbolt he should be as good a lover-or vice "
<p>
"vice
<p>
"that be a humorous alternative sire
he be a conversational trick to gain a smile-no more "
<p>
"i see
but morgan and he folly
"of course he be a fool sire else he would be turning soil in wale or burrow in the mine
he want something and he be idiot enough to think he could get he
because of he idiocy he do get he-part of he
he remember the princess "
<p>
the kingbolt be smile again
<p>
"i have never known any man to tell the truth to or about a woman
why be that john?"
<p>
"perhaps sire if he would explain the tiny scratch i see under he right eye he could understand
now the scratch be not there last night and he have the distinct look of
"yes-yes-a clumsy servant
let he speak of morgan
he have a way john of be secretly insult
sometimes he be not even conscious of he insult
he be a thing to put down if he be to be around court for any length of time "
<p>
1 5 3 iii
sir henry morgan sit on the judge bench at port royal
before he on the floor lay a slab of white sunlight like a blinding tomb
throughout the room an orchestra of fly sing he symphony of boredom
the drone voice of counsel be only loud instrument against the hum obbligato
court official go about sleepily and the case move on
<p>
"it be the fifteenth of the month he lord
williamson go to the cartwright property for the purpose of determine-determine to he own satisfaction he lord whether the tree stand as describe

<p>
"the proof?"
<p>
"he be detect he lord "
<p>
"did he or do he not steal four biscuit and a mirror?"
<p>
the prisoner face become even more sullen
<p>
"i tell 'em "
<p>
"my lord " the guard prompt
<p>
"my lord "
<p>
"why do he steal these articles?"
<p>
"i wan'ed 'em "
<p>
"say he lord "
<p>
"my lord "
<p>
"what do he want with them?"
"i wan'ed the biscuit for to eat "
<p>
"my lord "
<p>
"my lord "
<p>
"and the mirror?"
<p>
"i wan'ed the mirror for to look at himself in "
<p>
"my lord "
<p>
"my lord "
<p>
he lead the man to he imprisonment
now the guard bring in a thin pasty woman
<p>
"charged with harlotry and incontinence he lord "
<p>
"incontinence be illegal " say sir henry irritatedly "but since when have he be punish people for harlotry?"
<p>
"my lord the nature of this woman-the public health demand-he think the case would be understand "
<p>
"ah !
i see
he musth be lock up
take he away quickly "
<p>
the woman begin to cry sulkily
<p>
sir henry rest he forehead on he hands
he do not look up at the next prisoner
<p>
"charged with piracy on the high sea he lord ; with disturb the kingbolt peace ; with an act of war against a friendly nation "
<p>
sir henry glance quickly at the prisoner
one be a rotund little man with eyes of terror and the other a lean grizzled fellow who one arm be go
<p>
"what be the proof against the prisoners?"
<p>
"five witness he lord "
<p>
"so?
make he plea ! "
<p>
the tall man have put he good arm about the shoulder of he companion
<p>
"we plead guilty he lord "
<p>
"you plead guilty?"
sir henry cry in amazement
"but no pirate plead guilty
he be a case unprecedented "
<p>
"we plead guilty he lord "
<p>
"but why?"
<p>
"fifty people saw he in action he lord
why should he take up he time in deny what fifty people will swear to?
no he be resigned he lord
he be content both with the recent action and with he live "
the wiry arm squeeze about the small round tub of a buccaneer
<p>
henry sit very silently for a time
but finally he raise he tire eyes
"i sentence he to be hang "
<p>
"hanged he lord?"
<p>
"hanged by the neck until he be dead "
<p>
"you be change sir "
<p>
sir henry start forward and closely scrutinize the prisoner
then he lip smile
"yes " he say quietly "i be change
the henry morgan he know be not the sir henry morgan who sentence he to death
i do not kill ferociously any more but coldly and because i have to "
sir henry raise he voice
"let the court be clear but guard the door !
i wish to speak privately with the prisoner "
<p>
when he be alone he begin :
"i know well that i be change but tell he what be the change he see "
<p>
the burgundians look at each other
"you speak emil "
<p>
"you be change sir in this way
once he know what he be doing
he be sure of himself "
<p>
"that be so " break in the other
"you do not know-he be not sure of himself any more
once he be one man
he be possible to trust one man
but now he be several man
if he should trust one of he he should be in fear of the other "
<p>
sir henry laugh
"that be more or less true
he be not he fault but he be true
civilization will split up a character and he who refuse to split go under "
<p>
"we have forget about civilization thanks to he mother " antoine mutter fiercely
<p>
"what a pity to hang he "
<p>
"but be he so necessary to hang he sir?
could he not escape or be pardoned?"
<p>
"no he musth be hang
i be sorry but he musth be so
such be he duty "
<p>
"but duty to he friend sir-to the man who bore arms with he who mixed he blood with he
"listen other burgundian ; there be two kind of duty and he would know that if he remember he france
he mention one species and he be the weak kind
the other the giant duty-that which will not be overlook-might be call the duty of appearance
i do not hang he because he be pirate but because i be expect to hang pirate
i be sorry for he
i would like to scend he to he cell with saw in he pocket but i can

<p>
"that be so sir

he turn to he friend who stand shake in the grippe of horror
"you see such be the case emil
he do not like to tell he this thing because he hurt he
perhaps he punish himself in this manner for something he have done or fail to do
perhaps he remember chagres emil "
<p>
"chagres ! "
sir henry bent forward with excitement
"what happen after i sail away?

<p>
"you be cursed sir as he be give to few man to be cursed

i enjoy the scene rarely because i know that every man there envy he while he revile he

<p>
"and he scattered?"
<p>
"they scatter and die poor little child "
<p>
"anyway i should have hate to fall in with those poor little child !

<p>
"it be so
he be a grand fight and an ocean of plunder-but after all he know more about that last than he do "
<p>
"sometimes i doubt whether this body ever go to panama
i be sure this brain do not
i would like to stay and talk to he of that old time but he wife expect he
he be apt to fuss if i be late for luncheon "
he spoke jocosely
"when would he like to be hanged?"
<p>
the burgundians be whisper together
<p>
"ah there be that 'hanged' again
when would he like to be hanged?
any time sir
he do not wish to put he to the trouble but if he insist-any time there be a man and a rope idle "
antoine approach the table
"emil wish to offer one last compliment
he be a gift for he wife-a gift the history of which alone would make he valuable
emil have treasure this gift to the end and of this talisman he have reap a harvest-for talismanic he be in truth sir
but emil think he period of duty should end sir
he believe that by taking this means he can stop the series of event which have flow out from he treasure
and emil unfortunately will have no further use for he
emil kiss the hand of lady morgan-presents he respect and dignified compliment "
he drop a rose pearl on the table and turn quickly away
<p>
after he have be lead out sir henry sit at he bench and stare at the pearl
then he put he in he pocket and walk into the street
<p>
he came to the squat white palace of the lieutenant-governor
he be exactly as sir edward have left he
lady morgan would not have feel right if a detail have be change
he meet henry at the door
<p>
"we be to have dinner with the vaughns
and what be i to do about the coachman?
he's drunk
i've tell he and tell he to lock he closet but he will not pay attention to he
he sneak into the house and get a bottle off he shelf
he musth have done that "
<p>
"open he hand he dear
i have a gift for he "
<p>
he drop the rose pearl into he palm
<p>
for a moment he look at the rosy sphere and he face flush with pleasure but then he search he face suspiciously
<p>
"what have he be up to?"
<p>
"up to?
why i have be holding court "
<p>
"i suppose he get this in court ! "
he face light up
"i know !
he suspect he displeasure at he action last night
he be practically intoxicate if he musth know the truth ; and all the people be stare at he and whisper
do say a word
i saw them and i saw he
and now he want to bribe he feeling-he decency "
<p>
"suspected he displeasure !
he dear i suspect he all the way home with he and nearly all night after i get here
he be right
i strongly suspect he displeasure
in fact i be certain of he
but i will tell he the truth about the pearl "
<p>
"you will tell the truth only because he know he can deceive he henry
when will he give up the idea that i do know every little think he possess?"
<p>
"but i do try to deceive he
he do give he time "
<p>
"it take no more time to tell the truth than
"listen to he elizabeth please
i try two pirate this morning and he give he to he "
<p>
he smile a superior smile
"they give he to you?
why?
do he release them?
he would be like he to release them
sometimes i think he would still be one of them if he weren't for he
he never seem to realize henry that he be really i who have make he what he be-a knight and a gentleman
he make himself a buccaneer
but tell he do he release these pirates?"
<p>
"no ; i sentence them to death "
<p>
"ah !
then why do he give he the pearl?"
<p>
"my dear he give he to he because he have nothing else to do with he
he might have present he to the hangman but one would feel a trifle diffident about give pearl to the man who put a rope about one neck
friendship be possible with one hangman i should imagine
thus he give he to he and i he smile broadly and innocently "i be give he to he because i love he "
<p>
"well i can easily find out about the pirate and as to he affection he love he as long as i have he eye on he and no longer
i know he thoroughly
but i be glad he be hang
lord vaughn say he be a positive danger even to himself
he say he may stop fight spain at any moment and start on he
he say he be like vicious dog to be exterminate as soon as possible
i feel a little safe every time one of them be out of the way "
<p>
"but he dear lord vaughn know nothing about buccaneer while i
"henry why do he keep he here with he talk when he know i have a thousand thing to attend to
he think because he have all the time in the world that i can afford to help he idle
now do see to the coachman because i should be terribly embarrass if he be not fit
he livery will not suit jacob by any pinch
do i tell he he be drunk?
get he sober for tonight if he musth drown he to do he
now hurry along
i will feel right until i know he can sit up straight "
he turn to re-enter the house then came back and kiss he on the cheek
<p>
"it's really a nice pearl
thank he dear " he say
"of course i be going to have monsieur banzet value he
after what lord vaughn say i have very little faith in pirate
he might have be trying to bribe he with paste and he would never know the difference "
<p>
sir henry walk toward the stable
now as on other occasions he be gently move by uneasiness
now and then there came a vagrant feeling that in spite of all elizabeth's declamation to the effect that he know he thoroughly perhaps he really do
he be disquieting
<p>
1 5 4 iv
sir henry morgan lay in an enormous bed ; a bed so wide that he body under the coverlid seem a snow-covered mountain range divide two great plains
from the wall about the room the shiny eyes of he ancestor regard he
on he face be smirk which say "ah yes !
a knight to be sure-but he know how he buy he knighthood "
the air in the room be heavy and thick and hot
so always the air seem in a room where a man be about to die
<p>
sir henry be stare at the ceiling
for an hour he have be puzzle with this mysterious ceiling
nothing support he in the middle
why do he not fall?
he be late
every one about he be silent he go sneaking about pretend to be ghost he think
he be trying to convince he that he be dead already
he closed he eyes
he be too tire or too indifferent to keep them open
he hear the doctor come in and feel he reading the pulse
then the big confident voice boom :
"i be sorry lady morgan
there be nothing to do now
i do not even know what be the matter with he
some old jungle fever perhaps
i could bleed he again i suppose but he have take a great deal of blood already and he seem to do no good
however if he begin to sink i shall try he again "
<p>
"then he will die?"
lady morgan ask
henry think he show more curiosity than sorrow
<p>
"yes he will die unless god intervene
only god can be sure of he patient "
<p>
and then the room be clear of people
henry know that he wife be sitting near the bed
he could hear he crying softly beside he
"what a pity he be " he think "that i can go to death in a ship so he might pack he bag for he
he would give he so much satisfaction to know that i be enter heaven with a decent supply of clean linen "
<p>
"oh he husband-oh henry he husband "
<p>
he turn he head and look at he curiously and he gaze go deep into he eyes
suddenly he be seize with despair
<p>
"this woman love he " he say to himself
"this woman love he and i have never known he
i can know this kind of love
he eyes-he eyes-this be something far beyond he comprehension
can he have love he always?"
he look again
"she be very near to god
i think woman be near to god than man
he can talk about he but christ ! how he shine in he eyes
and he love he
during all he hector and badger and browbeat he have love he-and i have never known he
but what would i have done if i have known it?"
he turn away
this sorrow be too great too burning and awful to regard
he be terrify to see a woman soul shine through he eyes
<p>
so he be to die
he be rather pleasant if death be like this
he be warm and very tire
presently he would fall asleep and that would be death-brother death
<p>
he know that some other person have come into the room
he wife lean over until he came within he up-stare vision
he would be annoy if he know he could turn he head if he wish
<p>
"the vicar dear " he wife say
"do be nice to he
oh do listen to he !
he may help he-afterward "
ah he be practical !
he be going to see that some compact be make with the almighty if he could
he affection be an efficient thing but he love-that which glitter in he wet eyes be frightful
<p>
henry feel a warm soft hand take he
a soothe voice be talk to he
but he be difficult to listen
the ceiling be sway dangerously
<p>
"god be love " the voice be saying
"you musth put he faith in god "
<p>
"god be love " henry repeated mechanically
<p>
"let he pray " say the voice
<p>
suddenly henry remember a moment of he childhood
he be be torture with an earache and he mother be holding he in he arms
he stroke he wrist with he finger tip
"this be all nonsense " he be saying
he remember how he say he
"this be all nonsense
god be love
he will not let little boy suffer
now repeat after he lord be he shepherd
i shall not want '
" he be as though he administer a medicine
in the same tone he would have command "come take this oil ! "
<p>
henry feel the warm finger of the vicar creep to he wrist and begin a stroke movement
<p>
" 'the lord be he shepherd
i shall not want ' " henry drone sleepily
" 'he maketh he to lie down in green pasture " the stroke continue but more harshly
the vicar voice become more loud and authoritative
he be as though after year of patient wait the church have at last get henry morgan within he power
there be something almost gloat about the voice
<p>
"have he repent he sin sir henry?"
<p>
"my sins?
no i have not think of them
shall i repent panama?"
<p>
the vicar be embarrass
"well panama be a patriotic conquest
the kingbolt approve
besides the people be papist "
<p>
"but what be he sin then?"
henry go on
"i remember only the most pleasant and the most painful amongst them
somehow i do not wish to repent the pleasant one
he would be like breaking faith with them ; he be charming
and the painful sin carry atonement with them like conceal knife
how may i repent sir?
i might go over he whole life name and repent every act from the shatter of he first teethe ring to he last visit to a brothel
i might repent everything i could remember but if i forget one single sin the whole process would be waste "
<p>
"have he repent he sin sir henry?"
<p>
he realize then that he have not be talk at all
he be difficult to talk
he tongue have become lazy and sluggish
"no " he say
"i can remember them very well "
<p>
"you musth search in he heart for greed and lust and spite
he musth drive wickedness from he heart "
<p>
"but sir i do remember ever have be consciously wicked
i have done thing which seem wicked afterward but while i be doing them i always have some rather good end in view "
again he be conscious that he wasn't really speaking
<p>
"let he pray " the voice say
<p>
henry make a violent effort with he tongue
"no ! " he cry
<p>
"but he pray before "
<p>
"yes i pray before-because he mother would have like he
he would have want he to pray at least once more as a proof of he training than for any other reason a reassurance to he that he have done he duty by he "
<p>
"would he die heretic sir henry?
be he afraid of death?"
<p>
"i be too tire sir or too lazy to consider problem of heresy
and i be not afraid of death
i have see much violence and no man who i have admire be afraid of death but only of dye
he see sir death be an intellectual matter but dye be pure pain
and this death of mine be very pleasant so far
no sir ; i be not afraid even of dye
he be comfortable and he would be quiet if i could only be left alone
he be as though i be about to sleep after a great effort "
<p>
he hear the vicar voice again ; but though the warm hand still stroke he wrist the voice came from a mighty distance
<p>
"he will not answer he " the vicar be saying
"i be perplex for he soul "
<p>
then he hear he wife speaking to he
"you musth pray dear
every one do
how can he get to heaven if he do not pray?"
<p>
there he be again intent on making a contract with god
but henry do not want to look at he
nave though he philosophy be he eyes be as deep and as sad as the limitless sky
he want to say "i will want to get to heaven once i be dead
i will want them to disturb he "
he make such a commotion about this death
<p>
the doctor have come back into the room
"he be unconscious " the boom voice proclaim
"i think i will bleed he again "
<p>
henry feel the scalpel cut into he arm
he be pleasant
he hope he would cut he again and again
but the illusion be contradictory
rather than feeling the blood leave he he sense a curious warmth slip through he body
he breast and arms tingle as though some robust ancient wine be sing in he vein
<p>
now a queer change begin to take place
he found that he could see through he eyelid could see all about he without moving he head
the doctor and he wife and the vicar and even the room be sliding away from he
<p>
"they be moving " he think
"i be not moving
i be fixed
i be the center of all thing and can move
i be as heavy as the universe
perhaps i be the universe "
<p>
a low sweet tone be flow into he consciousness ; a vibrant rich organ tone which fill he seem to emanate from he brain to flood he body and from he to surge out over the world
he saw with a little surprise that the room have go
he be lie in an immeasurable dark grotto along the side of which be row of thick squat column make of some green glitter crystal
he be still in a recline position and the long grotto be sliding past he
of a sudden the movement stopped
he be surround by strange being have the body of child and bulbous heavy heads but no face
the flesh where he face should have be be solid and unbroken
these being be talk and chatter in dry raucous voice
henry be puzzle that he could talk without mouth
<p>
slowly the knowledge grow in he that these be he deed and he thought which be living with brother death
each one have go immediately to live with brother death as soon as he be born
when he know he identity the faceless little creature turn on he and clustered thickly about he couch
<p>
"why do he do me?" one cry
<p>
"i do not know ; i do not remember he "
<p>
"why do he think me?"
<p>
"i do not know
i musth have known but i have forget
he memory be slip away from he here in this grotto "
<p>
still insistently he question he and he voice be becoming more and more strident and harsh so that he overwhelm the great tone
<p>
"me ! answer he ! "
<p>
"no ; he ! "
<p>
"oh leave he !
let he rest " henry say wearily
"i be tire and i can tell he anything anyway "
<p>
then he saw that the little being be crouch before an approach forme
he turn toward the forme and cower and at length fell on he knee before he and raise tremble arms in gesture of supplication
<p>
henry strained he attention toward the figure
why he be elizabeth coming toward he-little elizabeth with golden hair and a wise young look on he face
he be girdle with cornflower and he eyes be strangely puzzle and bright
with a little start of surprise he notice henry
<p>
"i be elizabeth " he say
"you do not come to see he before he go away "
<p>
"i know
i think i be afraid to talk with he
but i stand in the darkness before he window and i whistle "
<p>
"did you?"
he smile at he gladly
"that be nice of he
i can see though why he should have be afraid of he-of such a little girl
he be silly of he "
<p>
"i do not know why " he say
"i run away
i be motivate by a power that be slip out of all the world
he memory be leave he one by one like a colony of aged swan flying off to some lonely island in the sea to die
but he become a princess do he not?" he question anxiously
<p>
"yes perhaps i do
i hope i do
i too forget
tell he do he really stand there in the dark?"
<p>
henry have notice a peculiar thing
if he look steadily at one of the crouch faceless being he disappear
he amuse himself by stare first at one and then at another until all of them be go
<p>
"did he really stand there in the dark?"
<p>
"i do not know
perhaps i only think i do "
he look for elizabeth but he too have disappear
in he place there be a red smoulder ember and the light be dye out of he
<p>
"wait elizabeth-wait
tell he where he father be
i want to see he father "
<p>
the dye ember answer he
<p>
"your father be happily dead
he be afraid to test even death "
<p>
"but merlin then-where be merlin?
if i could only find he "
<p>
"merlin?
he should know of he
merlin be herd dream in avalon "
<p>
the fire go out of the ember with a dry hard snap
there be no light anywhere
for a moment henry be conscious of the deep mellow pulsation of the tone
<p>
