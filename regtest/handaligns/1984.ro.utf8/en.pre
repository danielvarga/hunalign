it was a bright cold day in april and the clocks were striking thirteen
winston smith his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him
the hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats
at one end of it a coloured poster too large for indoor display had been tacked to the wall
it depicted simply an enormous face more than a metre wide : the face of a man of about forty-five with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features
winston made for the stairs
it was no use trying the lift
even at the best of times it was seldom working and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours
it was part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week
the flat was seven flights up and winston who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle went slowly resting several times on the way
on each landing opposite the lift-shaft the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall
it was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move
big brother is watching you the caption beneath it ran
inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron
the voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall
winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat though the words were still distinguishable
the instrument ( the telescreen it was called ) could be dimmed but there was no way of shutting it off completely
he moved over to the window : a smallish frail figure the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party
his hair was very fair his face naturally sanguine his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended
outside even through the shut window-pane the world looked cold
down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue there seemed to be no colour in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere
the blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner
there was one on the house-front immediately opposite
big brother is watching you the caption said while the dark eyes looked deep into winston 's own
down at streetlevel another poster torn at one corner flapped fitfully in the wind alternately covering and uncovering the single word ingsoc
in the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs hovered for an instant like a bluebottle and darted away again with a curving flight
it was the police patrol snooping into people 's windows
the patrols did not matter however
only the thought police mattered
behind winston 's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfillment of the ninth three-year plan
the telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously
any sound that winston made above the level of a very low whisper would be picked up by it moreover so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded he could be seen as well as heard
there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment
how often or on what system the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork
it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time
but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to
you had to live - did live from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized
winston kept his back turned to the telescreen
it was safer though as he well knew even a back can be revealing
a kilometre away the ministry of truth his place of work towered vast and white above the grimy landscape
this he thought with a sort of vague distaste - this was london chief city of airstrip one itself the third most populous of the provinces of oceania
he tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london had always been quite like this
were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses their sides shored up with baulks of timber their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions ?
and the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble ; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses ?
but it was no use he could not remember : nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible
ministry of truth - minitrue in newspeak - was startlingly different from any other object in sight
it was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete soaring up terrace after terrace 300 metres into the air
from where winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its white face in elegant lettering the three slogans of the party : war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
ministry of truth contained it was said three thousand rooms above ground level and corresponding ramifications below
scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size
so completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously
they were the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided
the ministry of truth which concerned itself with news entertainment education and the fine arts
the ministry of peace which concerned itself with war
the ministry of love which maintained law and order
and the ministry of plenty which was responsible for economic affairs
their names in newspeak : minitrue minipax miniluv and miniplenty
the ministry of love was the really frightening one
there were no windows in it at all
winston had never been inside the ministry of love nor within half a kilometre of it
it was a place impossible to enter except on official business and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements steel doors and hidden machine-gun nests
even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms armed with jointed truncheons
winston turned round abruptly
he had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen
he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen
by leaving the ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow 's breakfast
he took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin
it gave off a sickly oily smell as of chinese rice spirit
winston poured out nearly a teacupful nerved himself for a shock and gulped it down like a dose of medicine
instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes
the stuff was like nitric acid and moreover in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club
the next moment however the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful
he took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked victory cigarettes and incautiously held it upright whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor
with the next he was more successful
he went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen
from the table drawer he took out a penholder a bottle of ink and a thick quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover
for some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position
instead of being placed as was normal in the end wall where it could command the whole room it was in the longer wall opposite the window
to one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which winston was now sitting and which when the flats were built had probably been intended to hold bookshelves
by sitting in the alcove and keeping well back winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen so far as sight went
he could be heard of course but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen
it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do
but it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer
it was a peculiarly beautiful book
its smooth creamy paper a little yellowed by age was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past
he could guess however that the book was much older than that
he had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town ( just what quarter he did not now remember ) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it
party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ( dealing on the free market it was called ) but the rule was not strictly kept because there were various things such as shoelaces and razor blades which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way
he had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty
at the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose
he had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase
even with nothing written in it it was a compromising possession
the thing that he was about to do was to open a diary
this was not illegal ( nothing was illegal since there were no longer any laws ) but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death or at least by twenty-five years in a forced labour camp
winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off
the pen was an archaic instrument seldom used even for signatures and he had procured one furtively and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil
actually he was not used to writing by hand
apart from very short notes it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was of course impossible for his present purpose
he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second
a tremor had gone through his bowels
to mark the paper was the decisive act
in small clumsy letters he wrote :
april 4th 1984
he sat back
a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him
to begin with he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984
it must be round about that date since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945 ; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two
for whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was he writing this diary ?
for the future for the unborn
his mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page and then fetched up with a bump against the newspeak word doublethink
for the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him
how could you communicate with the future ?
it was of its nature impossible
either the future would resemble the present in which case it would not listen to him : or it would be different from it and his predicament would be meaningless
for some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper
the telescreen had changed over to strident military music
it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say
for weeks past he had been making ready for this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage
the actual writing would be easy
all he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head literally for years
at this moment however even the monologue had dried up
moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably
he dared not scratch it because if he did so it always became inflamed
the seconds were ticking by
he was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him the itching of the skin above his ankle the blaring of the music and a slight booziness caused by the gin
suddenly he began writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down
his small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops :
april 4th 1984
last night to the flicks
all war films
one very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean
audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water audience shouting with laughter when he sank
then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it
there was a middle-aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms
little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him
then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood
then there was a wonderful shot of a child 's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never -
winston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp
he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish
but the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down
it was he now realized because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today
it had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous could be said to happen
it was nearly eleven hundred and in the records department where winston worked they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation for the two minutes hate
winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight but had never spoken to came unexpectedly into the room
one of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors
he did not know her name but he knew that she worked in the fiction department
presumably - since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines
she was a bold-looking girl of about twenty-seven with thick hair a freckled face and swift athletic movements
a narrow scarlet sash emblem of the junior anti-sex league was wound several times round the waist of her overalls just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips
winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her
he knew the reason
it was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her
he disliked nearly all women and especially the young and pretty ones
it was always the women and above all the young ones who were the most bigoted adherents of the party the swallowers of slogans the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy
but this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most
once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror
the idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police
that it was true was very unlikely
still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenever she was anywhere near him
the other person was a man named o'brien a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dim idea of its nature
a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approaching
o'brien was a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face
in spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner
he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming - in some indefinable way curiously civilized
it was a gesture which if anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox
winston had seen o'brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years
he felt deeply drawn to him and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between o'brien 's urbane manner and his prize-fighter 's physique
much more it was because of a secretly held belief - or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope - that o'brien 's political orthodoxy was not perfect
something in his face suggested it irresistibly
and again perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face but simply intelligence
but at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone
winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess : indeed there was no way of doing so
at this moment o'brien glanced at his wrist-watch saw that it was nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over
he took a chair in the same row as winston a couple of places away
a small sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was between them
the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind
the next moment a hideous grinding speech as of some monstrous machine running without oil burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room
it was a noise that set one 's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one 's neck
the hate had started
as usual the face of emmanuel goldstein the enemy of the people had flashed on to the screen
there were hisses here and there among the audience
the little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust
goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long ago ( how long ago nobody quite remembered ) had been one of the leading figures of the party almost on a level with big brother himself and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities had been condemned to death and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared
the programmes of the two minutes hate varied from day to day but there was none in which goldstein was not the principal figure
he was the primal traitor the earliest defiler of the party 's purity
all subsequent crimes against the party all treacheries acts of sabotage heresies deviations sprang directly out of his teaching
somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies : perhaps somewhere beyond the sea under the protection of his foreign paymasters perhaps even - so it was occasionally rumoured - in some hiding-place in oceania itself
winston 's diaphragm was constricted
he could never see the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions
it was a lean jewish face with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard - a clever face and yet somehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched
it resembled the face of a sheep and the voice too had a sheep-like quality
goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the party - an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people less level-headed than oneself might be taken in by it
he was abusing big brother he was denouncing the dictatorship of the party he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia he was advocating freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed - and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the party and even contained newspeak words : more newspeak words indeed than any party member would normally use in real life
and all the while lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which goldstein 's specious claptrap covered behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the eurasian army - row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless asiatic faces who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished to be replaced by others exactly similar
the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers ' boots formed the background to goldstein 's bleating voice
before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room
the self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen and the terrifying power of the eurasian army behind it were too much to be borne : besides the sight or even the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger automatically
he was an object of hatred more constant than either eurasia or eastasia since when oceania was at war with one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other
but what was strange was that although goldstein was hated and despised by everybody although every day and a thousand times a day on platforms on the telescreen in newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashed ridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this his influence never seemed to grow less
always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him
a day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the thought police
he was the commander of a vast shadowy army an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state
the brotherhood its name was supposed to be
there were also whispered stories of a terrible book a compendium of all the heresies of which goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there
it was a book without a title
people referred to it if at all simply as the book
but one knew of such things only through vague rumours
neither the brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it
in its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy
people were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen
the little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish
even o'brien 's heavy face was flushed
he was sitting very straight in his chair his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave
the dark-haired girl behind winston had begun crying out swine ! swine ! swine ! and suddenly she picked up a heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen
it struck goldstein 's nose and bounced off ; the voice continued inexorably
in a lucid moment winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair
the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoid joining in
within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary
a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current turning one even against one 's will into a grimacing screaming lunatic
and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp
thus at one moment winston 's hatred was not turned against goldstein at all but on the contrary against big brother the party and the thought police ; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely derided heretic on the screen sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies
and yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him and all that was said of goldstein seemed to him to be true
at those moments his secret loathing of big brother changed into adoration and big brother seemed to tower up an invincible fearless protector standing like a rock against the hordes of asia and goldstein in spite of his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hung about his very existence seemed like some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization
it was even possible at moments to switch one 's hatred this way or that by a voluntary act
suddenly by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one 's head away from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him
vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind
he would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon
he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian
he would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax
better than before moreover he realized why it was that he hated her
he hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so because round her sweet supple waist which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm there was only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity
the hate rose to its climax
the voice of goldstein had become an actual sheep 's bleat and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep
then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing huge and terrible his sub-machine gun roaring and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats
but in the same moment drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure melted into the face of big brother black-haired blackmoustachio'd full of power and mysterious calm and so vast that it almost filled up the screen
nobody heard what big brother was saying
it was merely a few words of encouragement the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken
then the face of big brother faded away again and instead the three slogans of the party stood out in bold capitals : war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
but the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it had made on everyone 's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately
the little sandyhaired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her
with a tremulous murmur that sounded like my saviour ! she extended her arms towards the screen
then she buried her face in her hands
it was apparent that she was uttering a prayer
at this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep slow rhythmical chant of b-b ! . b-b ! . b-b ! - over and over again very slowly with a long pause between the first b and the second - a heavy murmurous sound somehow curiously savage in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms
for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up
it was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion
partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise
winston 's entrails seemed to grow cold
in the two minutes hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium but this sub-human chanting of b-b ! . b-b ! always filled him with horror
of course he chanted with the rest : it was impossible to do otherwise
to dissemble your feelings to control your face to do what everyone else was doing was an instinctive reaction
but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him
and it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened - if indeed it did happen
momentarily he caught o'brien 's eye
o'brien had stood up
he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture
but there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met and for as long as it took to happen winston knew - yes he knew ! - that o'brien was thinking the same thing as himself
an unmistakable message had passed
it was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes
i am with you o'brien seemed to be saying to him
i know precisely what you are feeling
i know all about your contempt your hatred your disgust
but don't worry i am on your side !
and then the flash of intelligence was gone and o'brien 's face was as inscrutable as everybody else 's
that was all and he was already uncertain whether it had happened
such incidents never had any sequel
all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the party
perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all - perhaps the brotherhood really existed !
it was impossible in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions to be sure that the brotherhood was not simply a myth
some days he believed in it some days not
there was no evidence only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing : snatches of overheard conversation faint scribbles on lavatory walls - once even when two strangers met a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition
it was all guesswork : very likely he had imagined everything
he had gone back to his cubicle without looking at o'brien again
the idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind
it would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it
for a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and that was the end of the story
but even that was a memorable event in the locked loneliness in which one had to live
winston roused himself and sat up straighter
he let out a belch
the gin was rising from his stomach
his eyes re-focused on the page
he discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing as though by automatic action
and it was no longer the same cramped awkward handwriting as before
his pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper printing in large neat capitals down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again filling half a page
he could not help feeling a twinge of panic
it was absurd since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether
he did not do so however because he knew that it was useless
whether he wrote down with big brother or whether he refrained from writing it made no difference
whether he went on with the diary or whether he did not go on with it made no difference
the thought police would get him just the same
he had committed - would still have committed even if he had never set pen to paper - the essential crime that contained all others in itself
thoughtcrime they called it
thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever
you might dodge successfully for a while even for years but sooner or later they were bound to get you
it was always at night - the arrests invariably happened at night
the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shaking your shoulder the lights glaring in your eyes the ring of hard faces round the bed
in the vast majority of cases there was no trial no report of the arrest
people simply disappeared always during the night
your name was removed from the registers every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten
you were abolished annihilated : vaporized was the usual word
for a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria
he began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl :
theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother
he sat back in his chair slightly ashamed of himself and laid down the pen
the next moment he started violently
there was a knocking at the door
already !
he sat as still as a mouse in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt
but no the knocking was repeated
the worst thing of all would be to delay
his heart was thumping like a drum but his face from long habit was probably expressionless
he got up and moved heavily towards the door
as he put his hand to the door-knob winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table
down with big brother was written all over it in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room
it was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done
but he realized even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet
he drew in his breath and opened the door
instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him
a colourless crushed-looking woman with wispy hair and a lined face was standing outside
oh comrade she began in a dreary whining sort of voice i thought i heard you come in
do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink ?
it 's got blocked up and -
it was mrs parsons the wife of a neighbour on the same floor
 ( mrs was a word somewhat discountenanced by the party - you were supposed to call everyone comrade - but with some women one used it instinctively ) 
she was a woman of about thirty but looking much older
one had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face
winston followed her down the passage
these amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation
victory mansions were old flats built in 1930 or thereabouts and were falling to pieces
the plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls the pipes burst in every hard frost the roof leaked whenever there was snow the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy
repairs except what you could do for yourself had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years
of course it 's only because tom isn't home said mrs parsons vaguely
the parsons ' flat was bigger than winston 's and dingy in a different way
everything had a battered trampled-on look as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal
games impedimenta - hockey-sticks boxing-gloves a burst football a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out - lay all over the floor and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books
on the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies and a full-sized poster of big brother
there was the usual boiled-cabbage smell common to the whole building but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat which - one knew this at the first sniff though it was hard to say how was the sweat of some person not present at the moment
in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen
it 's the children said mrs parsons casting a half-apprehensive glance at the door
they haven't been out today
and of course -
she had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle
the kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage
winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe
he hated using his hands and he hated bending down which was always liable to start him coughing
mrs parsons looked on helplessly
of course if tom was home he 'd put it right in a moment she said
he loves anything like that
he 's ever so good with his hands tom is
parsons was winston 's fellow-employee at the ministry of truth
he was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity a mass of imbecile enthusiasms - one of those completely unquestioning devoted drudges on whom more even than on the thought police the stability of the party depended
at thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the youth league and before graduating into the youth league he had managed to stay on in the spies for a year beyond the statutory age
at the ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the sports committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes spontaneous demonstrations savings campaigns and voluntary activities generally
he would inform you with quiet pride between whiffs of his pipe that he had put in an appearance at the community centre every evening for the past four years
an overpowering smell of sweat a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life followed him about wherever he went and even remained behind him after he had gone
have you got a spanner ?
said winston fiddling with the nut on the angle-joint
a spanner said mrs parsons immediately becoming invertebrate
i don't know i 'm sure
perhaps the children -
there was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the living-room
mrs parsons brought the spanner
winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe
he cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room
up with your hands ! yelled a savage voice
a handsome tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol while his small sister about two years younger made the same gesture with a fragment of wood
both of them were dressed in the blue shorts grey shirts and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the spies
winston raised his hands above his head but with an uneasy feeling so vicious was the boy 's demeanour that it was not altogether a game
you 're a traitor ! yelled the boy
you 're a thought-criminal !
you 're a eurasian spy !
i 'll shoot you i 'll vaporize you i 'll send you to the salt mines !
suddenly they were both leaping round him shouting traitor ! and thought-criminal ! the little girl imitating her brother in every movement
it was somehow slightly frightening like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters
there was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy 's eye a quite evident desire to hit or kick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so
it was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding winston thought
mrs parsons ' eyes flitted nervously from winston to the children and back again
in the better light of the living-room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face
they do get so noisy she said
they 're disappointed because they couldn't go to see the hanging that 's what it is
i 'm too busy to take them and tom won't be back from work in time
why can't we go and see the hanging ?
roared the boy in his huge voice
want to see the hanging !
want to see the hanging ! chanted the little girl still capering round
some eurasian prisoners guilty of war crimes were to be hanged in the park that evening winston remembered
this happened about once a month and was a popular spectacle
children always clamoured to be taken to see it
he took his leave of mrs parsons and made for the door
but he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow
it was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him
he spun round just in time to see mrs parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult
goldstein ! bellowed the boy as the door closed on him
but what most struck winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman 's greyish face
back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again still rubbing his neck
the music from the telescreen had stopped
instead a clipped military voice was reading out with a sort of brutal relish a description of the armaments of the new floating fortress which had just been anchored between iceland and the faroe islands
with those children he thought that wretched woman must lead a life of terror
another year two years and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy
nearly all children nowadays were horrible
what was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the party
on the contrary they adored the party and everything connected with it
the songs the processions the banners the hiking the drilling with dummy rifles the yelling of slogans the worship of big brother - it was all a sort of glorious game to them
all their ferocity was turned outwards against the enemies of the state against foreigners traitors saboteurs thought-criminals
it was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children
and with good reason for hardly a week passed in which the times did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak - child hero was the phrase generally used - had overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the thought police
the sting of the catapult bullet had worn off
he picked up his pen half-heartedly wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary
suddenly he began thinking of o'brien again
years ago - how long was it ?
seven years it must be - he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room
and someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed : we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness
it was said very quietly almost casually - a statement not a command
he had walked on without pausing
what was curious was that at the time in the dream the words had not made much impression on him
it was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance
he could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen o'brien for the first time nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as o'brien 's
but at any rate the identification existed
it was o'brien who had spoken to him out of the dark
winston had never been able to feel sure - even after this morning 's flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether o'brien was a friend or an enemy
nor did it even seem to matter greatly
there was a link of understanding between them more important than affection or partisanship
we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness he had said
winston did not know what it meant only that in some way or another it would come true
the voice from the telescreen paused
a trumpet call clear and beautiful floated into the stagnant air
the voice continued raspingly :
attention !
your attention please !
a newsflash has this moment arrived from the malabar front
our forces in south india have won a glorious victory
i am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end
here is the newsflash -
bad news coming thought winston
and sure enough following on a gory description of the annihilation of a eurasian army with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners came the announcement that as from next week the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty
winston belched again
the gin was wearing off leaving a deflated feeling
the telescreen - perhaps to celebrate the victory perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate - crashed into oceania 't is for thee
you were supposed to stand to attention
however in his present position he was invisible
oceania 't is for thee gave way to lighter music
winston walked over to the window keeping his back to the telescreen
the day was still cold and clear
somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull reverberating roar
about twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on london at present
down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro and the word ingsoc fitfully appeared and vanished
ingsoc
the sacred principles of ingsoc
newspeak doublethink the mutability of the past
he felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster
he was alone
the past was dead the future was unimaginable
what certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side ?
and what way of knowing that the dominion of the party would not endure for ever ?
like an answer the three slogans on the white face of the ministry of truth came back to him : war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength he took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket
there too in tiny clear lettering the same slogans were inscribed and on the other face of the coin the head of big brother
even from the coin the eyes pursued you
on coins on stamps on the covers of books on banners on posters and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet - everywhere
always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you
asleep or awake working or eating indoors or out of doors in the bath or in bed - no escape
nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull
the sun had shifted round and the myriad windows of the ministry of truth with the light no longer shining on them looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress
his heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape
it was too strong it could not be stormed
a thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down
he wondered again for whom he was writing the diary
for the future for the past - for an age that might be imaginary
and in front of him there lay not death but annihilation
the diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour
only the thought police would read what he had written before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory
how could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper could physically survive ?
the telescreen struck fourteen
he must leave in ten minutes
he had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty
curiously the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him
he was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear
but so long as he uttered it in some obscure way the continuity was not broken
it was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage
he went back to the table dipped his pen and wrote :
to the future or to the past to a time when thought is free when men are different from one another and do not live alone - to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone :
from the age of uniformity from the age of solitude from the age of big brother from the age of doublethink - greetings !
he was already dead he reflected
it seemed to him that it was only now when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts that he had taken the decisive step
the consequences of every act are included in the act itself
he wrote :
thoughtcrime does not entail death : thoughtcrime is death
now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible
two fingers of his right hand were inkstained
it was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you
some nosing zealot in the ministry ( a woman probably : someone like the little sandy-haired woman or the dark-haired girl from the fiction department ) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval why he had used an oldfashioned pen what he had been writing - and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter
he went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose
he put the diary away in the drawer
it was quite useless to think of hiding it but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered
a hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious
with the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved
winston was dreaming of his mother
he must he thought have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared
she was a tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair
his father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin dressed always in neat dark clothes ( winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father 's shoes ) and wearing spectacles
the two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties
at this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him with his young sister in her arms
he did not remember his sister at all except as a tiny feeble baby always silent with large watchful eyes
both of them were looking up at him
they were down in some subterranean place - the bottom of a well for instance or a very deep grave - but it was a place which already far below him was itself moving downwards
they were in the saloon of a sinking ship looking up at him through the darkening water
there was still air in the saloon they could still see him and he them but all the while they were sinking down down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever
he was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death and they were down there because he was up here
he knew it and they knew it and he could see the knowledge in their faces
there was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things
he could not remember what had happened but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own
it was one of those dreams which while retaining the characteristic dream scenery are a continuation of one 's intellectual life and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake
the thing that now suddenly struck winston was that his mother 's death nearly thirty years ago had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible
tragedy he perceived belonged to the ancient time to a time when there was still privacy love and friendship and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason
his mother 's memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him when he was too young and selfish to love her in return and because somehow he did not remember how she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable
such things he saw could not happen today
today there were fear hatred and pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complex sorrows
all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister looking up at him through the green water hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking
suddenly he was standing on short springy turf on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground
the landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world
in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country
it was an old rabbit-bitten pasture with a foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there
in the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women 's hair
somewhere near at hand though out of sight there was a clear slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees
the girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field
with what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside
her body was white and smooth but it aroused no desire in him indeed he barely looked at it
what overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside
with its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture a whole system of thought as though big brother and the party and the thought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm
that too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time
winston woke up with the word shakespeare on his lips
the telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds
it was nought seven fifteen getting-up time for office workers
winston wrenched his body out of bed - naked for a member of the outer party received only 3 000 clothing coupons annually and a suit of pyjamas was 600 - and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair
the physical jerks would begin in three minutes
the next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up
it emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps
his veins had swelled with the effort of the cough and the varicose ulcer had started itching
thirty to forty group ! yapped a piercing female voice
thirty to forty group !
take your places please
thirties to forties !
winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen upon which the image of a youngish woman scrawny but muscular dressed in tunic and gym-shoes had already appeared
arms bending and stretching ! she rapped out
take your time by me
one two three four !
one two three four !
come on comrades put a bit of life into it !
one two three four !
one two three four ! .
the pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of winston 's mind the impression made by his dream and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat
as he mechanically shot his arms back and forth wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the physical jerks he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood
it was extraordinarily difficult
beyond the late fifties everything faded
when there were no external records that you could refer to even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness
you remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing
everything had been different then
even the names of countries and their shapes on the map had been different
airstrip one for instance had not been so called in those days : it had been called england or britain though london he felt fairly certain had always been called london
winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise
perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchester
he did not remember the raid itself but he did remember his father 's hand clutching his own as they hurried down down down into some place deep in the earth round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest
his mother in her slow dreamy way was following a long way behind them
she was carrying his baby sister - or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying : he was not certain whether his sister had been born then
finally they had emerged into a noisy crowded place which he had realized to be a tube station
there were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor and other people packed tightly together were sitting on metal bunks one above the other
winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk
the old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair : his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears
he reeked of gin
it seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin
but though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable
in his childish way winston grasped that some terrible thing something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied had just happened
it also seemed to him that he knew what it was
someone whom the old man loved - a little granddaughter perhaps had been killed
every few minutes the old man kept repeating :
we didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em
i said so ma didn't i ?
that 's what comes of trusting 'em
i said so all along
we didn't ought to 'ave trusted the buggers
but which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted winston could not now remember
since about that time war had been literally continuous though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war
for several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in london itself some of which he remembered vividly
but to trace out the history of the whole period to say who was fighting whom at any given moment would have been utterly impossible since no written record and no spoken word ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one
at this moment for example in 1984 ( if it was 1984 ) oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia
in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines
actually as winston well knew it was only four years since oceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia
but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control
officially the change of partners had never happened
oceania was at war with eurasia : therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia
the enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible
the frightening thing he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward ( with hands on hips they were gyrating their bodies from the waist an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles ) - the frightening thing was that it might all be true
if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event it never happened - that surely was more terrifying than mere torture and death ?
the party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia
he winston smith knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four years ago
but where did that knowledge exist ?
only in his own consciousness which in any case must soon be annihilated
and if all others accepted the lie which the party imposed - if all records told the same tale - then the lie passed into history and became truth
who controls the past ran the party slogan controls the future : who controls the present controls the past
and yet the past though of its nature alterable never had been altered
whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting
it was quite simple
all that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory
reality control they called it : in newspeak doublethink
stand easy ! barked the instructress a little more genially
winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air
his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink
to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again : and above all to apply the same process to the process itself
that was the ultimate subtlety : consciously to induce unconsciousness and then once again to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed
even to understand the word doublethink involved the use of doublethink
the instructress had called them to attention again
and now let 's see which of us can touch our toes ! she said enthusiastically
right over from the hips please comrades
one-two !
one-two ! .
winston loathed this exercise which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit
the half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations
the past he reflected had not merely been altered it had been actually destroyed
for how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory ?
he tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of big brother
he thought it must have been at some time in the sixties but it was impossible to be certain
in the party histories of course big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the revolution since its very earliest days
his exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in great gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides
there was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented
winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence
he did not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before 1960 but it was possible that in its oldspeak form - english socialism that is to say - it had been current earlier
everything melted into mist
sometimes indeed you could put your finger on a definite lie
it was not true for example as was claimed in the party history books that the party had invented aeroplanes
he remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood
but you could prove nothing
there was never any evidence
just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact
and on that occasion -
smith ! screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen 6079 smith w !
yes you !
bend lower please !
you can do better than that
you 're not trying
lower please !
that 's better comrade
now stand at ease the whole squad and watch me
a sudden hot sweat had broken out all over winston 's body
his face remained completely inscrutable
never show dismay !
never show resentment !
a single flicker of the eyes could give you away
he stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head and - one could not say gracefully but with remarkable neatness and efficiency - bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes
there comrades !
that 's how i want to see you doing it
watch me again
i 'm thirty-nine and i 've had four children
now look
she bent over again
you see my knees aren't bent
you can all do it if you want to she added as she straightened herself up
anyone under forty-five is perfectly capable of touching his toes
we don't all have the privilege of fighting in the front line but at least we can all keep fit
remember our boys on the malabar front !
and the sailors in the floating fortresses !
just think what they have to put up with
now try again
that 's better comrade that 's much better she added encouragingly as winston with a violent lunge succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent for the first time in several years
with the deep unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day 's work started winston pulled the speakwrite towards him blew the dust from its mouthpiece and put on his spectacles
then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk
in the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices
to the right of the speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for written messages to the left a larger one for newspapers ; and in the side wall within easy reach of winston 's arm a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating
this last was for the disposal of waste paper
similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor
for some reason they were nicknamed memory holes
when one knew that any document was due for destruction or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building
winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled
each contained a message of only one or two lines in the abbreviated jargon - not actually newspeak but consisting largely of newspeak words - which was used in the ministry for internal purposes
they ran :
with a faint feeling of satisfaction winston laid the fourth message aside
it was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last
the other three were routine matters though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures
winston dialled back numbers on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of the times which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes ' delay
the messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter or as the official phrase had it to rectify
for example it appeared from the times of the seventeenth of march that big brother in his speech of the previous day had predicted that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in north africa
as it happened the eurasian higher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone
it was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brother 's speech in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened
or again the times of the nineteenth of december had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983 which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth three-year plan
today 's issue contained a statement of the actual output from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong
winston 's job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones
as for the third message it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes
as short a time ago as february the ministry of plenty had issued a promise ( a categorical pledge were the official words ) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984
actually as winston was aware the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week
all that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april
as soon as winston had dealt with each of the messages he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube
then with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames
what happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led he did not know in detail but he did know in general terms
as soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the times had been assembled and collated that number would be reprinted the original copy destroyed and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead
this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers but to books periodicals pamphlets posters leaflets films sound-tracks cartoons photographs - to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance
day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date
in this way every prediction made by the party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct nor was any item of news or any expression of opinion which conflicted with the needs of the moment ever allowed to remain on record
all history was a palimpsest scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary
in no case would it have been possible once the deed was done to prove that any falsification had taken place
the largest section of the records department far larger than the one on which winston worked consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books newspapers and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction
a number of the times which might because of changes in political alignment or mistaken prophecies uttered by big brother have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date and no other copy existed to contradict it
books also were recalled and rewritten again and again and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made
even the written instructions which winston received and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed : always the reference was to slips errors misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy
but actually he thought as he re-adjusted the ministry of plenty 's figures it was not even forgery
it was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another
most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie
statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version
a great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head
for example the ministry of plenty 's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs
the actual output was given as sixty-two millions
winston however in rewriting the forecast marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled
in any case sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fiftyseven millions or than 145 millions
very likely no boots had been produced at all
likelier still nobody knew how many had been produced much less cared
all one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper while perhaps half the population of oceania went barefoot
and so it was with every class of recorded fact great or small
everything faded away into a shadow-world in which finally even the date of the year had become uncertain
winston glanced across the hall
in the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small precise-looking dark-chinned man named tillotson was working steadily away with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite
he had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen
he looked up and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in winston 's direction
winston hardly knew tillotson and had no idea what work he was employed on
people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs
in the long windowless hall with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the two minutes hate
he knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed
there was a certain fitness in this since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier
and a few cubicles away a mild ineffectual dreamy creature named ampleforth with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres was engaged in producing garbled versions - definitive texts they were called - of poems which had become ideologically offensive but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies
and this hall with its fifty workers or thereabouts was only one sub-section a single cell as it were in the huge complexity of the records department
beyond above below were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs
there were the huge printingshops with their sub-editors their typography experts and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs
there was the tele-programmes section with its engineers its producers and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices
there were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall
there were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed
and somewhere or other quite anonymous there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved that one falsified and the other rubbed out of existence
and the records department after all was itself only a single branch of the ministry of truth whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of oceania with newspapers films textbooks telescreen programmes plays novels - with every conceivable kind of information instruction or entertainment from a statue to a slogan from a lyric poem to a biological treatise and from a child 's spelling-book to a newspeak dictionary
and the ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat
there was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature music drama and entertainment generally
here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport crime and astrology sensational five-cent novelettes films oozing with sex and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator
there was even a whole sub-section - pornosec it was called in newspeak - engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography which was sent out in sealed packets and which no party member other than those who worked on it was permitted to look at
three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while winston was working but they were simple matters and he had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him
when the hate was over he returned to his cubicle took the newspeak dictionary from the shelf pushed the speakwrite to one side cleaned his spectacles and settled down to his main job of the morning
winston 's greatest pleasure in life was in his work
most of it was a tedious routine but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem - delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and your estimate of what the party wanted you to say
winston was good at this kind of thing
on occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of the times leading articles which were written entirely in newspeak
he unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier
it ran :
times 3 12 83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
in oldspeak ( or standard english ) this might be rendered :
the reporting of big brother 's order for the day in the times of december 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent persons
rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing
winston read through the offending article
big brother 's order for the day it seemed had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as ffcc which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the floating fortresses
a certain comrade withers a prominent member of the inner party had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration the order of conspicuous merit second class
three months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given
one could assume that withers and his associates were now in disgrace but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen
that was to be expected since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced
the great purges involving thousands of people with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years
more commonly people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were never heard of again
one never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them
in some cases they might not even be dead
perhaps thirty people personally known to winston not counting his parents had disappeared at one time or another
winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip
in the cubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite
he raised his head for a moment : again the hostile spectacle-flash
winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself
it was perfectly possible
so tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person : on the other hand to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place
very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually said
and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes of cross-referencing that would be required and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth
winston did not know why withers had been disgraced
perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence
perhaps big brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate
perhaps withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies
or perhaps - what was likeliest of all - the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government
the only real clue lay in the words refs unpersons which indicated that withers was already dead
you could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested
sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed
very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing this time for ever
withers however was already an unperson
he did not exist : he had never existed
winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of big brother 's speech
it was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject
he might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought-criminals but that was a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front or some triumph of over-production in the ninth three-year plan might complicate the records too much
what was needed was a piece of pure fantasy
suddenly there sprang into his mind ready made as it were the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who had recently died in battle in heroic circumstances
there were occasions when big brother devoted his order for the day to commemorating some humble rank-and-file party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed
today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy
it was true that there was no such person as comrade ogilvy but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence
winston thought for a moment then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in big brother 's familiar style : a style at once military and pedantic and because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them ( what lessons do we learn from this fact comrades ?
the lesson - which is also one of the fundamental principles of ingsoc - that etc etc ) easy to imitate
at the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum a sub-machine gun and a model helicopter
at six - a year early by a special relaxation of the rules - he had joined the spies at nine he had been a troop leader
at eleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies
at seventeen he had been a district organizer of the junior anti-sex league
at nine teen he had designed a hand-grenade which had been adopted by the ministry of peace and which at its first trial had killed thirtyone eurasian prisoners in one burst
at twenty-three he had perished in action
pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the indian ocean with important despatches he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water despatches and all - an end said big brother which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy
big brother added a few remarks on the purity and single-mindedness of comrade ogilvy 's life
he was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium and had taken a vow of celibacy believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty
he had no subjects of conversation except the principles of ingsoc and no aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spies saboteurs thoughtcriminals and traitors generally
winston debated with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit : in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail
once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle
something seemed to tell him with certainty that tillotson was busy on the same job as himself
there was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own
comrade ogilvy unimagined an hour ago was now a fact
it struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones
comrade ogilvy who had never existed in the present now existed in the past and when once the act of forgery was forgotten he would exist just as authentically and upon the same evidence as charlemagne or julius caesar
in the low-ceilinged canteen deep underground the lunch queue jerked slowly forward
the room was already very full and deafeningly noisy
from the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of victory gin
on the far side of the room there was a small bar a mere hole in the wall where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip
just the man i was looking for said a voice at winston 's back
he turned round
it was his friend syme who worked in the research department
perhaps friend was not exactly the right word
you did not have friends nowadays you had comrades : but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others
syme was a philologist a specialist in newspeak
indeed he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary
he was a tiny creature smaller than winston with dark hair and large protuberant eyes at once mournful and derisive which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you
i wanted to ask you whether you 'd got any razor blades he said
not one ! said winston with a sort of guilty haste
i 've tried all over the place
they don't exist any longer
everyone kept asking you for razor blades
actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up
there had been a famine of them for months past
at any given moment there was some necessary article which the party shops were unable to supply
sometimes it was buttons sometimes it was darning wool sometimes it was shoelaces ; at present it was razor blades
you could only get hold of them if at all by scrounging more or less furtively on the free market
i 've been using the same blade for six weeks he added untruthfully
the queue gave another jerk forward
as they halted he turned and faced syme again
each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter
did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday ?
said syme
i was working said winston indifferently
i shall see it on the flicks i suppose
a very inadequate substitute said syme
his mocking eyes roved over winston 's face
i know you the eyes seemed to say i see through you
i know very well why you didn't go to see those prisoners hanged
in an intellectual way syme was venomously orthodox
he would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages and trials and confessions of thought-criminals the executions in the cellars of the ministry of love
talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him if possible in the technicalities of newspeak on which he was authoritative and interesting
winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes
it was a good hanging said syme reminiscently
i think it spoils it when they tie their feet together
i like to see them kicking
and above all at the end the tongue sticking right out and blue a quite bright blue
that 's the detail that appeals to me
nex' please ! yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle
winston and syme pushed their trays beneath the grille
on to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch - a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew a hunk of bread a cube of cheese a mug of milkless victory coffee and one saccharine tablet
there 's a table over there under that telescreen said syme
let 's pick up a gin on the way
the gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs
they threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metal-topped table on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit
winston took up his mug of gin paused for an instant to collect his nerve and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down
when he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry
he began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew which in among its general sloppiness had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat
neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins
from the table at winston 's left a little behind his back someone was talking rapidly and continuously a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck which pierced the general uproar of the room
how is the dictionary getting on ?
said winston raising his voice to overcome the noise
slowly said syme
i 'm on the adjectives
it 's fascinating
he had brightened up immediately at the mention of newspeak
he pushed his pannikin aside took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting
the eleventh edition is the definitive edition he said
we 're getting the language into its final shape - the shape it 's going to have when nobody speaks anything else
when we 've finished with it people like you will have to learn it all over again
you think i dare say that our chief job is inventing new words
but not a bit of it !
we 're destroying words - scores of them hundreds of them every day
we 're cutting the language down to the bone
the eleventh edition won't contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 2050
he bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls then continued speaking with a sort of pedant 's passion
his thin dark face had become animated his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy
it 's a beautiful thing the destruction of words
of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well
it isn't only the synonyms ; there are also the antonyms
after all what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word ?
a word contains its opposite in itself
take good for instance
if you have a word like good what need is there for a word like bad ?
ungood will do just as well - better because it 's an exact opposite which the other is not
or again if you want a stronger version of good what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like excellent and splendid and all the rest of them ?
plusgood covers the meaning or doubleplusgood if you want something stronger still
of course we use those forms already but in the final version of newspeak there 'll be nothing else
in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words - in reality only one word
don't you see the beauty of that winston ?
it was b b 's idea originally of course he added as an afterthought
a sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winston 's face at the mention of big brother
nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm
you haven't a real appreciation of newspeak winston he said almost sadly
even when you write it you 're still thinking in oldspeak
i 've read some of those pieces that you write in the times occasionally
they 're good enough but they 're translations
in your heart you 'd prefer to stick to oldspeak with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning
you don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words
do you know that newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year ?
winston did know that of course
he smiled sympathetically he hoped not trusting himself to speak
syme bit off another fragment of the dark-coloured bread chewed it briefly and went on :
don't you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of thought ?
in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be no words in which to express it
every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten
already in the eleventh edition we 're not far from that point
but the process will still be continuing long after you and i are dead
every year fewer and fewer words and the range of consciousness always a little smaller
even now of course there 's no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime
it 's merely a question of self-discipline reality-control
but in the end there won't be any need even for that
the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect
newspeak is ingsoc and ingsoc is newspeak he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction
has it ever occurred to you winston that by the year 2050 at the very latest not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now ?
except - began winston doubtfully and he stopped
it had been on the tip of his tongue to say except the proles but he checked himself not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox
syme however had divined what he was about to say
the proles are not human beings he said carelessly
by 2050 earlier probably - all real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappeared
the whole literature of the past will have been destroyed
chaucer shakespeare milton byron - they 'll exist only in newspeak versions not merely changed into something different but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be
even the literature of the party will change
even the slogans will change
how could you have a slogan like freedom is slavery when the concept of freedom has been abolished ?
the whole climate of thought will be different
in fact there will be no thought as we understand it now
orthodoxy means not thinking - not needing to think
orthodoxy is unconsciousness
one of these days thought winston with sudden deep conviction syme will be vaporized
he is too intelligent
he sees too clearly and speaks too plainly
the party does not like such people
one day he will disappear
it is written in his face
winston had finished his bread and cheese
he turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee
at the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away
a young woman who was perhaps his secretary and who was sitting with her back to winston was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said
from time to time winston caught some such remark as i think you 're so right i do so agree with you uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice
but the other voice never stopped for an instant even when the girl was speaking
winston knew the man by sight though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the fiction department
he was a man of about thirty with a muscular throat and a large mobile mouth
his head was thrown back a little and because of the angle at which he was sitting his spectacles caught the light and presented to winston two blank discs instead of eyes
what was slightly horrible was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word
just once winston caught a phrase - complete and final elimination of goldsteinism - jerked out very rapidly and as it seemed all in one piece like a line of type cast solid
for the rest it was just a noise a quackquack-quacking
and yet though you could not actually hear what the man was saying you could not be in any doubt about its general nature
he might be denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the eurasian army he might be praising big brother or the heroes on the malabar front - it made no difference
whatever it was you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy pure ingsoc
as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy
it was not the man 's brain that was speaking it was his larynx
the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words but it was not speech in the true sense : it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness like the quacking of a duck
syme had fallen silent for a moment and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew
the voice from the other table quacked rapidly on easily audible in spite of the surrounding din
there is a word in newspeak said syme i don't know whether you know it : duckspeak to quack like a duck
it is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings
applied to an opponent it is abuse applied to someone you agree with it is praise
unquestionably syme will be vaporized winston thought again
he thought it with a kind of sadness although well knowing that syme despised him and slightly disliked him and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so
there was something subtly wrong with syme
there was something that he lacked : discretion aloofness a sort of saving stupidity
you could not say that he was unorthodox
he believed in the principles of ingsoc he venerated big brother he rejoiced over victories he hated heretics not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal an up-to-dateness of information which the ordinary party member did not approach
yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him
he said things that would have been better unsaid he had read too many books he frequented the chestnut tree cafe haunt of painters and musicians
there was no law not even an unwritten law against frequenting the chestnut tree cafe yet the place was somehow ill-omened
the old discredited leaders of the party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged
goldstein himself it was said had sometimes been seen there years and decades ago
syme 's fate was not difficult to foresee
and yet it was a fact that if syme grasped even for three seconds the nature of his winston 's secret opinions he would betray him instantly to the thought police
so would anybody else for that matter : but syme more than most
zeal was not enough
orthodoxy was unconsciousness
syme looked up
here comes parsons he said
something in the tone of his voice seemed to add that bloody fool
parsons winston 's fellow-tenant at victory mansions was in fact threading his way across the room - a tubby middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face
at thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline but his movements were brisk and boyish
his whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts grey shirt and red neckerchief of the spies
in visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms
parsons did indeed invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so
he greeted them both with a cheery hullo hullo ! and sat down at the table giving off an intense smell of sweat
beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face
his powers of sweating were extraordinary
at the community centre you could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle
syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his fingers
look at him working away in the lunch hour said parsons nudging winston
keenness eh ?
what 's that you 've got there old boy ?
something a bit too brainy for me i expect
smith old boy i 'll tell you why i 'm chasing you
it 's that sub you forgot to give me
which sub is that ?
said winston automatically feeling for money
about a quarter of one 's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them
for hate week
you know - the house-by-house fund
i 'm treasurer for our block
we 're making an all-out effort - going to put on a tremendous show
i tell you it won't be my fault if old victory mansions doesn't have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street
two dollars you promised me
winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes which parsons entered in a small notebook in the neat handwriting of the illiterate
by the way old boy he said i hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday
i gave him a good dressing down for it
in fact i told him i 'd take the catapult away if he does it again
i think he was a little upset at not going to the execution said winston
ah well - what i mean to say shows the right spirit doesn't it ?
mischievous little beggars they are both of them but talk about keenness !
all they think about is the spies and the war of course
d' you know what that little girl of mine did last saturday when her troop was on a hike out berkhamsted way ?
she got two other girls to go with her slipped off from the hike and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man
they kept on his tail for two hours right through the woods and then when they got into amersham handed him over to the patrols
what did they do that for ?
said winston somewhat taken aback
parsons went on triumphantly :
my kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent - might have been dropped by parachute for instance
but here 's the point old boy
what do you think put her on to him in the first place ?
she spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoes - said she 'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before
so the chances were he was a foreigner
pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh ?
what happened to the man ?
said winston
ah that i couldn't say of course
but i wouldn't be altogether surprised if - parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle and clicked his tongue for the explosion
good said syme abstractedly without looking up from his strip of paper
of course we can't afford to take chances agreed winston dutifully
what i mean to say there is a war on said parsons
as though in confirmation of this a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads
however it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time but merely an announcement from the ministry of plenty
comrades ! cried an eager youthful voice
attention comrades !
we have glorious news for you
we have won the battle for production !
returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past year
all over oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the new happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us
here are some of the completed figures
foodstuffs -
the phrase our new happy life recurred several times
it had been a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty
parsons his attention caught by the trumpet call sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity a sort of edified boredom
he could not follow the figures but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction
he had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco
with the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top
winston was smoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal
the new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left
for the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen
it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week
and only yesterday he reflected it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week
was it possible that they could swallow that after only twenty-four hours ?
yes they swallowed it
parsons swallowed it easily with the stupidity of an animal
the eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically passionately with a furious desire to track down denounce and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes
syme too - in some more complex way involving doublethink syme swallowed it
was he then alone in the possession of a memory ?
the fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen
as compared with last year there was more food more clothes more houses more furniture more cooking-pots more fuel more ships more helicopters more books more babies - more of everything except disease crime and insanity
year by year and minute by minute everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards
as syme had done earlier winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the table drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern
he meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life
had it always been like this ?
had food always tasted like this ?
he looked round the canteen
a low-ceilinged crowded room its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies ; battered metal tables and chairs placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching ; bent spoons dented trays coarse white mugs ; all surfaces greasy grime in every crack ; and a sourish composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes
always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to
it was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different
in any time that he could accurately remember there had never been quite enough to eat one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes furniture had always been battered and rickety rooms underheated tube trains crowded houses falling to pieces bread dark-coloured tea a rarity coffee filthy-tasting cigarettes insufficient - nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin
and though of course it grew worse as one 's body aged was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things if one 's heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity the interminable winters the stickiness of one 's socks the lifts that never worked the cold water the gritty soap the cigarettes that came to pieces the food with its strange evil tastes ?
why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different ?
he looked round the canteen again
nearly everyone was ugly and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls
on the far side of the room sitting at a table alone a small curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side
how easy it was thought winston if you did not look about you to believe that the physical type set up by the party as an ideal - tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens blond-haired vital sunburnt carefree - existed and even predominated
actually so far as he could judge the majority of people in airstrip one were small dark and ill-favoured
it was curious how that beetle-like type proliferated in the ministries : little dumpy men growing stout very early in life with short legs swift scuttling movements and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes
it was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the party
the announcement from the ministry of plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music
parsons stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures took his pipe out of his mouth
the ministry of plenty 's certainly done a good job this year he said with a knowing shake of his head
by the way smith old boy i suppose you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have ?
not one said winston
i 've been using the same blade for six weeks myself
ah well - just thought i 'd ask you old boy
sorry said winston
the quacking voice from the next table temporarily silenced during the ministry 's announcement had started up again as loud as ever
for some reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parsons with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face
within two years those children would be denouncing her to the thought police
mrs parsons would be vaporized
syme would be vaporized
winston would be vaporized
o'brien would be vaporized
parsons on the other hand would never be vaporized
the eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized
the little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of ministries they too would never be vaporized
and the girl with dark hair the girl from the fiction department - she would never be vaporized either
it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish : though just what it was that made for survival it was not easy to say
at this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk
the girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him
it was the girl with dark hair
she was looking at him in a sidelong way but with curious intensity
the instant she caught his eye she looked away again
the sweat started out on winston 's backbone
a horrible pang of terror went through him
it was gone almost at once but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind
why was she watching him ?
why did she keep following him about ?
unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived or had come there afterwards
but yesterday at any rate during the two minutes hate she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so
quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough
his earlier thought returned to him : probably she was not actually a member of the thought police but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all
he did not know how long she had been looking at him but perhaps for as much as five minutes and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control
it was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen
the smallest thing could give you away
a nervous tic an unconscious look of anxiety a habit of muttering to yourself - anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality of having something to hide
in any case to wear an improper expression on your face ( to look incredulous when a victory was announced for example ) was itself a punishable offence
there was even a word for it in newspeak : facecrime it was called
the girl had turned her back on him again
perhaps after all she was not really following him about perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running
his cigarette had gone out and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table
he would finish smoking it after work if he could keep the tobacco in it
quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the thought police and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of love within three days but a cigarette end must not be wasted
syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket
parsons had begun talking again
did i ever tell you old boy he said chuckling round the stem of his pipe about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market-woman 's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of b b ?
sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches
burned her quite badly i believe
little beggars eh ?
but keen as mustard !
that 's a first-rate training they give them in the spies nowadays - better than in my day even
what d' you think 's the latest thing they 've served them out with ?
ear trumpets for listening through keyholes !
my little girl brought one home the other night - tried it out on our sitting-room door and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole
of course it 's only a toy mind you
still gives 'em the right idea eh ?
at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle
it was the signal to return to work
all three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts and the remaining tobacco fell out of winston 's cigarette
winston was writing in his diary :
it was three years ago
it was on a dark evening in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway stations
she was standing near a doorway in the wall under a street lamp that hardly gave any light
she had a young face painted very thick
it was really the paint that appealed to me the whiteness of it like a mask and the bright red lips
party women never paint their faces
there was nobody else in the street and no telescreens
she said two dollars
i -
for the moment it was too difficult to go on
he shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring
he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice
or to bang his head against the wall to kick over the table and hurl the inkpot through the window - to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him
your worst enemy he reflected was your own nervous system
at any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom
he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back ; a quite ordinary-looking man a party member aged thirty-five to forty tallish and thin carrying a brief-case
they were a few metres apart when the left side of the man 's face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm
it happened again just as they were passing one another : it was only a twitch a quiver rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter but obviously habitual
he remembered thinking at the time : that poor devil is done for
and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious
the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep
there was no way of guarding against that so far as he could see
he drew his breath and went on writing :
i went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen
there was a bed against the wall and a lamp on the table turned down very low
she -
his teeth were set on edge
he would have liked to spit
simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine his wife
winston was married - had been married at any rate : probably he still was married so far as he knew his wife was not dead
he seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring because no woman of the party ever used scent or could be imagined as doing so
only the proles used scent
in his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication
when he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts
consorting with prostitutes was forbidden of course but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break
it was dangerous but it was not a life-and-death matter
to be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp : not more if you had committed no other offence
and it was easy enough provided that you could avoid being caught in the act
the poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves
some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin which the proles were not supposed to drink
tacitly the party was even inclined to encourage prostitution as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed
mere debauchery did not matter very much so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class
the unforgivable crime was promiscuity between party members
but - though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to - it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening
the aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control
its real undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act
not love so much as eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside it
all marriages between party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose and - though the principle was never clearly stated - permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another
the only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the party
sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema
this again was never put into plain words but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every party member from childhood onwards
there were even organizations such as the junior anti-sex league which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes
all children were to be begotten by artificial insemination ( artsem it was called in newspeak ) and brought up in public institutions
this winston was aware was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party
the party was trying to kill the sex instinct or if it could not be killed then to distort it and dirty it
he did not know why this was so but it seemed natural that it should be so
and as far as the women were concerned the party 's efforts were largely successful
he thought again of katharine
it must be nine ten - nearly eleven years since they had parted
it was curious how seldom he thought of her
for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married
they had only been together for about fifteen months
the party did not permit divorce but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children
katharine was a tall fair-haired girl very straight with splendid movements
she had a bold aquiline face a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it
very early in her married life he had decided - though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people - that she had without exception the most stupid vulgar empty mind that he had ever encountered
she had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan and there was no imbecility absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the party handed it out to her
the human sound-track he nicknamed her in his own mind
yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing - sex
as soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen
to embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image
and what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength
the rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression
she would lie there with shut eyes neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting
it was extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible
but even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate
but curiously enough it was katharine who refused this
they must she said produce a child if they could
so the performance continued to happen once a week quite regularity whenever it was not impossible
she even used to remind him of it in the morning as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten
she had two names for it
one was making a baby and the other was our duty to the party ( yes she had actually used that phrase ) 
quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round
but luckily no child appeared and in the end she agreed to give up trying and soon afterwards they parted
winston sighed inaudibly
he picked up his pen again and wrote :
she threw herself down on the bed and at once without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way you can imagine pulled up her skirt
i -
he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharine 's white body frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the party
why did it always have to be like this ?
why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years ?
but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event
the women of the party were all alike
chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty
by careful early conditioning by games and cold water by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league by lectures parades songs slogans and martial music the natural feeling had been driven out of them
his reason told him that there must be exceptions but his heart did not believe it
they were all impregnable as the party intended that they should be
and what he wanted more even than to be loved was to break down that wall of virtue even if it were only once in his whole life
the sexual act successfully performed was rebellion
desire was thoughtcrime
even to have awakened katharine if he could have achieved it would have been like a seduction although she was his wife
but the rest of the story had got to be written down
he wrote :
i turned up the lamp
when i saw her in the light -
after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright
for the first time he could see the woman properly
he had taken a step towards her and then halted full of lust and terror
he was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here
it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out : for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment
if he went away without even doing what he had come here to do - !
it had got to be written down it had got to be confessed
what he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old
the paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask
there were streaks of white in her hair ; but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness
she had no teeth at all
he wrote hurriedly in scrabbling handwriting :
when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman fifty years old at least
but i went ahead and did it just the same
he pressed his fingers against his eyelids again
he had written it down at last but it made no difference
the therapy had not worked
the urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever
if there is hope [ wrote winston ] it lies in the proles
if there was hope it must lie in the proles because only there in those swarming disregarded masses 85 per cent of the population of oceania could the force to destroy the party ever be generated
the party could not be overthrown from within
its enemies if it had any enemies had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another
even if the legendary brotherhood existed as just possibly it might it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes
rebellion meant a look in the eyes an inflexion of the voice at the most an occasional whispered word
but the proles if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength would have no need to conspire
they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies
if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning
surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it ?
and yet - !
he remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women 's voices - had burst from a side-street a little way ahead
it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair a deep loud oh-o-o-o-oh ! that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell
his heart had leapt
it 's started ! he had thought
a riot !
the proles are breaking loose at last !
when he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship
but at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels
it appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans
they were wretched flimsy things but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get
now the supply had unexpectedly given out
the successful women bumped and jostled by the rest were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall accusing the stallkeeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve
there was a fresh outburst of yells
two bloated women one of them with her hair coming down had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another 's hands
for a moment they were both tugging and then the handle came off
winston watched them disgustedly
and yet just for a moment what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats !
why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered ?
he wrote :
until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious
that he reflected might almost have been a transcription from one of the party textbooks
the party claimed of course to have liberated the proles from bondage
before the revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists they had been starved and flogged women had been forced to work in the coal mines ( women still did work in the coal mines as a matter of fact ) children had been sold into the factories at the age of six
but simultaneously true to the principles of doublethink the party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection like animals by the application of a few simple rules
in reality very little was known about the proles
it was not necessary to know much
so long as they continued to work and breed their other activities were without importance
left to themselves like cattle turned loose upon the plains of argentina they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them a sort of ancestral pattern
they were born they grew up in the gutters they went to work at twelve they passed through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire they married at twenty they were middle-aged at thirty they died for the most part at sixty
heavy physical work the care of home and children petty quarrels with neighbours films football beer and above all gambling filled up the horizon of their minds
to keep them in control was not difficult
a few agents of the thought police moved always among them spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous ; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party
it was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings
all that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations
and even when they became discontented as they sometimes did their discontent led nowhere because being without general ideas they could only focus it on petty specific grievances
the larger evils invariably escaped their notice
the great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes
even the civil police interfered with them very little
there was a vast amount of criminality in london a whole world-within-a-world of thieves bandits prostitutes drug-peddlers and racketeers of every description ; but since it all happened among the proles themselves it was of no importance
in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code
the sexual puritanism of the party was not imposed upon them
promiscuity went unpunished divorce was permitted
for that matter even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it
they were beneath suspicion
as the party slogan put it : proles and animals are free
winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer
it had begun itching again
the thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been like
he took out of the drawer a copy of a children 's history textbook which he had borrowed from mrs parsons and began copying a passage into the diary :
in the old days [ it ran ] before the glorious revolution london was not the beautiful city that we know today
it was a dark dirty miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under
children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water
but in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them
these rich men were called capitalists
they were fat ugly men with wicked faces like the one in the picture on the opposite page
you can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat and a queer shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe which was called a top hat
this was the uniform of the capitalists and no one else was allowed to wear it
the capitalists owned everything in the world and everyone else was their slave
they owned all the land all the houses all the factories and all the money
if anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison or they could take his job away and starve him to death
when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him and take off his cap and address him as sir
the chief of all the capitalists was called the king and -
but he knew the rest of the catalogue
there would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves the judges in their ermine robes the pillory the stocks the treadmill the cat-o'-nine tails the lord mayor 's banquet and the practice of kissing the pope 's toe
there was also something called the jus primae noctis which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children
it was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories
how could you tell how much of it was lies ?
it might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the revolution
the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different
it struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity but simply its bareness its dinginess its listlessness
life if you looked about you bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve
great areas of it even for a party member were neutral and non-political a matter of slogging through dreary jobs fighting for a place on the tube darning a worn-out sock cadging a saccharine tablet saving a cigarette end
the ideal set up by the party was something huge terrible and glittering - a world of steel and concrete of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons - a nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually working fighting triumphing persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face
the reality was decaying dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories
he seemed to see a vision of london vast and ruinous city of a million dustbins and mixed up with it was a picture of mrs parsons a woman with lined face and wispy hair fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe
he reached down and scratched his ankle again
day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food more clothes better houses better recreations - that they lived longer worked shorter hours were bigger healthier stronger happier more intelligent better educated than the people of fifty years ago
not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved
the party claimed for example that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate : before the revolution it was said the number had only been 15 per cent
the party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand whereas before the revolution it had been 300 - and so it went on
it was like a single equation with two unknowns
it might very well be that literally every word in the history books even the things that one accepted without question was pure fantasy
for all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis or any such creature as a capitalist or any such garment as a top hat
everything faded into mist
the past was erased the erasure was forgotten the lie became truth
just once in his life he had possessed - after the event : that was what counted - concrete unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification
he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds
in 1973 it must have been - at any rate it was at about the time when he and katharine had parted
but the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier
the story really began in the middle sixties the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all
by 1970 none of them was left except big brother himself
all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counter-revolutionaries
goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where and of the others a few had simply disappeared while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes
among the last survivors were three men named jones aaronson and rutherford
it must have been in 1965 that these three had been arrested
as often happened they had vanished for a year or more so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way
they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy ( at that date too the enemy was eurasia ) embezzlement of public funds the murder of various trusted party members intrigues against the leadership of big brother which had started long before the revolution happened and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people
after confessing to these things they had been pardoned reinstated in the party and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important
all three had written long abject articles in the times analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends
some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them in the chestnut tree cafe
he remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye
they were men far older than himself relics of the ancient world almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the party
the glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them
he had the feeling though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of big brother
but also they were outlaws enemies untouchables doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two
no one who had once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end
they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave
there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them
it was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people
they were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe
of the three it was rutherford whose appearance had most impressed winston
rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution
even now at long intervals his cartoons were appearing in the times
they were simply an imitation of his earlier manner and curiously lifeless and unconvincing
always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes - slum tenements starving children street battles capitalists in top hats - even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless hopeless effort to get back into the past
he was a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey hair his face pouched and seamed with thick negroid lips
at one time he must have been immensely strong ; now his great body was sagging sloping bulging falling away in every direction
he seemed to be breaking up before one 's eyes like a mountain crumbling
it was the lonely hour of fifteen
winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such a time
the place was almost empty
a tinny music was trickling from the telescreens
the three men sat in their corner almost motionless never speaking
uncommanded the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin
there was a chessboard on the table beside them with the pieces set out but no game started
and then for perhaps half a minute in all something happened to the telescreens
the tune that they were playing changed and the tone of the music changed too
there came into it - but it was something hard to describe
it was a peculiar cracked braying jeering note : in his mind winston called it a yellow note
and then a voice from the telescreen was singing :
the three men never stirred
but when winston glanced again at rutherford 's ruinous face he saw that his eyes were full of tears
and for the first time he noticed with a kind of inward shudder and yet not knowing at what he shuddered that both aaronson and rutherford had broken noses
a little later all three were re-arrested
it appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release
at their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again with a whole string of new ones
they were executed and their fate was recorded in the party histories a warning to posterity
about five years after this in 1973 winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten
the instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance
it was a half-page torn out of the times of about ten years earlier - the top half of the page so that it included the date - and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some party function in new york
prominent in the middle of the group were jones aaronson and rutherford
there was no mistaking them in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom
the point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil
they had flown from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvous somewhere in siberia and had conferred with members of the eurasian general staff to whom they had betrayed important military secrets
the date had stuck in winston 's memory because it chanced to be midsummer day ; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well
there was only one possible conclusion : the confessions were lies
of course this was not in itself a discovery
even at that time winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of
but this was concrete evidence ; it was a fragment of the abolished past like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory
it was enough to blow the party to atoms if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known
he had gone straight on working
as soon as he saw what the photograph was and what it meant he had covered it up with another sheet of paper
luckily when he unrolled it it had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen
he took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible
to keep your face expressionless was not difficult and even your breathing could be controlled with an effort : but you could not control the beating of your heart and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up
he let what he judged to be ten minutes go by tormented all the while by the fear that some accident - a sudden draught blowing across his desk for instance - would betray him
then without uncovering it again he dropped the photograph into the memory hole along with some other waste papers
within another minute perhaps it would have crumbled into ashes
that was ten - eleven years ago
today probably he would have kept that photograph
it was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now when the photograph itself as well as the event it recorded was only memory
was the party 's hold upon the past less strong he wondered because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed ?
but today supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes the photograph might not even be evidence
already at the time when he made his discovery oceania was no longer at war with eurasia and it must have been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country
since then there had been other changes - two three he could not remember how many
very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance
the past not only changed but changed continuously
what most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken
the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious but the ultimate motive was mysterious
he took up his pen again and wrote :
i understand how : i do not understand why
he wondered as he had many times wondered before whether he himself was a lunatic
perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one
at one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun ; today to believe that the past is inalterable
he might be alone in holding that belief and if alone then a lunatic
but the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him : the horror was that he might also be wrong
he picked up the children 's history book and looked at the portrait of big brother which formed its frontispiece
the hypnotic eyes gazed into his own
it was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you - something that penetrated inside your skull battering against your brain frightening you out of your beliefs persuading you almost to deny the evidence of your senses
in the end the party would announce that two and two made five and you would have to believe it
it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later : the logic of their position demanded it
not merely the validity of experience but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy
the heresy of heresies was common sense
and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise but that they might be right
for after all how do we know that two and two make four ?
or that the force of gravity works ?
or that the past is unchangeable ?
if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself is controllable what then ?
but no !
his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord
the face of o'brien not called up by any obvious association had floated into his mind
he knew with more certainty than before that o'brien was on his side
he was writing the diary for o'brien - to o'brien : it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact
the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
it was their final most essential command
his heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him the ease with which any party intellectual would overthrow him in debate the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand much less answer
and yet he was in the right !
they were wrong and he was right
the obvious the silly and the true had got to be defended
truisms are true hold on to that !
the solid world exists its laws do not change
stones are hard water is wet objects unsupported fall towards the earth 's centre
with the feeling that he was speaking to o'brien and also that he was setting forth an important axiom he wrote :
freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four
if that is granted all else follows
from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee - real coffee not victory coffee - came floating out into the street
winston paused involuntarily
for perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood
then a door banged seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound
he had walked several kilometres over pavements and his varicose ulcer was throbbing
this was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the community centre : a rash act since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the centre was carefully checked
in principle a party member had no spare time and was never alone except in bed
it was assumed that when he was not working eating or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation : to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude even to go for a walk by yourself was always slightly dangerous
there was a word for it in newspeak : ownlife it was called meaning individualism and eccentricity
but this evening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air had tempted him
the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year and suddenly the long noisy evening at the centre the boring exhausting games the lectures the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin had seemed intolerable
on impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of london first south then east then north again losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going
if there is hope he had written in the diary it lies in the proles
the words kept coming back to him statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity
he was somewhere in the vague brown-coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been saint pancras station
he was walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes
there were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles
in and out of the dark doorways and down narrow alley-ways that branched off on either side people swarmed in astonishing numbers - girls in full bloom with crudely lipsticked mouths and youths who chased the girls and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years ' time and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers
perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up
most of the people paid no attention to winston ; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity
two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway
winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached
yes i says to 'er that 's all very well i says
but if you 'd of been in my place you 'd of done the same as what i done
it 's easy to criticize i says but you ain't got the same problems as what i got
ah said the other that 's jest it
that 's jest where it is
the strident voices stopped abruptly
the women studied him in hostile silence as he went past
but it was not hostility exactly ; merely a kind of wariness a momentary stiffening as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal
the blue overalls of the party could not be a common sight in a street like this
indeed it was unwise to be seen in such places unless you had definite business there
the patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them
may i see your papers comrade ?
what are you doing here ?
what time did you leave work ?
is this your usual way home ?
- and so on and so forth
not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route : but it was enough to draw attention to you if the thought police heard about it
suddenly the whole street was in commotion
there were yells of warning from all sides
people were shooting into the doorways like rabbits
a young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of winston grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle whipped her apron round it and leapt back again all in one movement
at the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit who had emerged from a side alley ran towards winston pointing excitedly to the sky
steamer ! he yelled
look out guv'nor !
bang over'ead !
lay down quick !
steamer was a nickname which for some reason the proles applied to rocket bombs
winston promptly flung himself on his face
the proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind
they seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound
winston clasped his forearms above his head
there was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave ; a shower of light objects pattered on to his back
when he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window
he walked on
the bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the street
a black plume of smoke hung in the sky and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins
there was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak
when he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist
apart from the bloody stump the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast
he kicked the thing into the gutter and then to avoid the crowd turned down a side-street to the right
within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened
it was nearly twenty hours and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ( pubs they called them ) were choked with customers
from their grimy swing doors endlessly opening and shutting there came forth a smell of urine sawdust and sour beer
in an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men were standing very close together the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder
even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies
it was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading
he was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation
for a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows
can't you bleeding well listen to what i say ?
i tell you no number ending in seven ain't won for over fourteen months !
yes it ' as then !
no it ' as not !
back 'ome i got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper
i takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock
an' i tell you no number ending in seven -
yes a seven 'as won !
i could pretty near tell you the bleeding number
four oh seven it ended in
it were in february - second week in february
february your grandmother !
i got it all down in black and white
an' i tell you no number -
oh pack it in ! said the third man
they were talking about the lottery
winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres
they were still arguing with vivid passionate faces
the lottery with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention
it was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive
it was their delight their folly their anodyne their intellectual stimulant
where the lottery was concerned even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory
there was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems forecasts and lucky amulets
winston had nothing to do with the running of the lottery which was managed by the ministry of plenty but he was aware ( indeed everyone in the party was aware ) that the prizes were largely imaginary
only small sums were actually paid out the winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons
in the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of oceania and another this was not difficult to arrange
but if there was hope it lay in the proles
you had to cling on to that
when you put it in words it sounded reasonable : it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith
the street into which he had turned ran downhill
he had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away
from somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices
the street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tired-looking vegetables
at this moment winston remembered where he was
the alley led out into the main street and down the next turning not five minutes away was the junk-shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary
and in a small stationer 's shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink
he paused for a moment at the top of the steps
on the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust
a very old man bent but active with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn pushed open the swing door and went in
as winston stood watching it occurred to him that the old man who must be eighty at the least had already been middle-aged when the revolution happened
he and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism
in the party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the revolution
the older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender
if there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century it could only be a prole
suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into winston 's mind and a lunatic impulse took hold of him
he would go into the pub he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him
he would say to him : tell me about your life when you were a boy
what was it like in those days ?
were things better than they are now or were they worse ?
hurriedly lest he should have time to become frightened he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street
it was madness of course
as usual there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed
if the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness but it was not likely that they would believe him
he pushed open the door and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face
as he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume
behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls
a game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds
the old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar having some kind of altercation with the barman a large stout hook-nosed young man with enormous forearms
a knot of others standing round with glasses in their hands were watching the scene
i arst you civil enough didn't i ?
said the old man straightening his shoulders pugnaciously
you telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the 'ole bleeding boozer ?
and what in hell 's name is a pint ?
said the barman leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter
ark at 'im !
calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is !
why a pint 's the 'alf of a quart and there 's four quarts to the gallon
'ave to teach you the a b c next
never heard of 'em said the barman shortly
litre and half litre - that 's all we serve
there 's the glasses on the shelf in front of you
i likes a pint persisted the old man
you could 'a drawed me off a pint easy enough
we didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when i was a young man
when you were a young man we were all living in the treetops said the barman with a glance at the other customers
there was a shout of laughter and the uneasiness caused by winston 's entry seemed to disappear
the old man 's whitestubbled face had flushed pink
he turned away muttering to himself and bumped into winston
winston caught him gently by the arm
may i offer you a drink ?
he said
you 're a gent said the other straightening his shoulders again
he appeared not to have noticed winston 's blue overalls
pint ! he added aggressively to the barman
pint of wallop
the barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter
beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs
the proles were supposed not to drink gin though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough
the game of darts was in full swing again and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets
winston 's presence was forgotten for a moment
there was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard
it was horribly dangerous but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in
'e could 'a drawed me off a pint grumbled the old man as he settled down behind a glass
a 'alf litre ain't enough
it don't satisfy
and a 'ole litre 's too much
it starts my bladder running
let alone the price
you must have seen great changes since you were a young man said winston tentatively
the old man 's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar and from the bar to the door of the gents as though it were in the bar-room that he expected the changes to have occurred
the beer was better he said finally
and cheaper !
when i was a young man mild beer - wallop we used to call it - was fourpence a pint
that was before the war of course
which war was that ?
said winston
it 's all wars said the old man vaguely
he took up his glass and his shoulders straightened again
'ere 's wishing you the very best of 'ealth !
in his lean throat the sharp-pointed adam 's apple made a surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement and the beer vanished
winston went to the bar and came back with two more half-litres
the old man appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full litre
you are very much older than i am said winston
you must have been a grown man before i was born
you can remember what it was like in the old days before the revolution
people of my age don't really know anything about those times
we can only read about them in books and what it says in the books may not be true
i should like your opinion on that
the history books say that life before the revolution was completely different from what it is now
there was the most terrible oppression injustice poverty worse than anything we can imagine
here in london the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death
half of them hadn't even boots on their feet
they worked twelve hours a day they left school at nine they slept ten in a room
and at the same time there were a very few people only a few thousands - the capitalists they were called - who were rich and powerful
they owned everything that there was to own
they lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants they rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages they drank champagne they wore top hats -
the old man brightened suddenly
top 'ats ! he said
funny you should mention 'em
the same thing come into my 'ead only yesterday i dono why
i was jest thinking i ain't seen a top 'at in years
gorn right out they 'ave
the last time i wore one was at my sister-in-law 's funeral
and that was - well i couldn't give you the date but it must 'a been fifty years ago
of course it was only 'ired for the occasion you understand
it isn't very important about the top hats said winston patiently
the point is these capitalists - they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them - were the lords of the earth
everything existed for their benefit
you - the ordinary people the workers - were their slaves
they could do what they liked with you
they could ship you off to canada like cattle
they could sleep with your daughters if they chose
they could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine tails
you had to take your cap off when you passed them
every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who -
the old man brightened again
lackeys ! he said
now there 's a word i ain't 'eard since ever so long
lackeys !
that reg'lar takes me back that does
i recollect oh donkey 's years ago - i used to sometimes go to 'yde_park of a sunday afternoon to 'ear the blokes making speeches
salvation army roman catholics jews indians - all sorts there was
and there was one bloke - well i couldn't give you 'is name but a real powerful speaker 'e was
'e didn't 'alf give it 'em !
lackeys ! 'e says lackeys of the bourgeoisie !
flunkies of the ruling class !
parasites - that was another of them
and 'yenas - 'e definitely called 'em 'yenas
of course 'e was referring to the labour party you understand
winston had the feeling that they were talking at crosspurposes
what i really wanted to know was this he said
do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days ?
are you treated more like a human being ?
in the old days the rich people the people at the top -
the 'ouse of lords put in the old man reminiscently
the house of lords if you like
what i am asking is were these people able to treat you as an inferior simply because they were rich and you were poor ?
is it a fact for instance that you had to call them sir and take off your cap when you passed them ?
the old man appeared to think deeply
he drank off about a quarter of his beer before answering
yes he said
they liked you to touch your cap to 'em
it showed respect like
i didn't agree with it myself but i done it often enough
had to as you might say
and was it usual - i 'm only quoting what i 've read in history books - was it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter ?
one of 'em pushed me once said the old man
i recollect it as if it was yesterday
it was boat race night - terribly rowdy they used to get on boat race night - and i bumps into a young bloke on shaftesbury avenue
quite a gent 'e was - dress shirt top 'at black overcoat
'e was kind of zig-zagging across the pavement and i bumps into 'im accidental-like
'e says why can't you look where you 're going ?
'e says
i say ju think you 've bought the bleeding pavement ?
'e says i 'll twist your bloody 'ead off if you get fresh with me
i says you 're drunk
i 'll give you in charge in 'alf a minute i says
an' if you 'll believe me 'e puts 'is 'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus
well i was young in them days and i was going to 'ave fetched 'im one only -
a sense of helplessness took hold of winston
the old man 's memory was nothing but a rubbish-heap of details
one could question him all day without getting any real information
the party histories might still be true after a fashion : they might even be completely true
he made a last attempt
perhaps i have not made myself clear he said
what i 'm trying to say is this
you have been alive a very long time ; you lived half your life before the revolution
in 1925 for instance you were already grown up
would you say from what you can remember that life in 1925 was better than it is now or worse ?
if you could choose would you prefer to live then or now ?
the old man looked meditatively at the darts board
he finished up his beer more slowly than before
when he spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air as though the beer had mellowed him
i know what you expect me to say he said
you expect me to say as i 'd sooner be young again
most people 'd say they 'd sooner be young if you arst ' 'em
you got your 'ealth and strength when you 're young
when you get to my time of life you ain't never well
i suffer something wicked from my feet and my bladder 's jest terrible
six and seven times a night it 'as me out of bed
on the other 'and there 's great advantages in being a old man
you ain't got the same worries
no truck with women and that 's a great thing
i ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year if you 'd credit it
nor wanted to what 's more
winston sat back against the window-sill
it was no use going on
he was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room
the extra half-litre was already working on him
winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again
within twenty years at the most he reflected the huge and simple question was life better before the revolution than it is now ?
would have ceased once and for all to be answerable
but in effect it was unanswerable even now since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another
they remembered a million useless things a quarrel with a workmate a hunt for a lost bicycle pump the expression on a long-dead sister 's face the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago : but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision
they were like the ant which can see small objects but not large ones
and when memory failed and written records were falsified - when that happened the claim of the party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted because there did not exist and never again could exist any standard against which it could be tested
at this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly
he halted and looked up
he was in a narrow street with a few dark little shops interspersed among dwelling-houses
immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded
he seemed to know the place
of course !
he was standing outside the junk-shop where he had bought the diary
a twinge of fear went through him
it had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning and he had sworn never to come near the place again
and yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander his feet had brought him back here of their own accord
it was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary
at the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open
with the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement he stepped through the doorway
if questioned he could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades
the proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell
he was a man of perhaps sixty frail and bowed with a long benevolent nose and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles
his hair was almost white but his eyebrows were bushy and still black
his spectacles his gentle fussy movements and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet gave him a vague air of intellectuality as though he had been some kind of literary man or perhaps a musician
his voice was soft as though faded and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles
i recognized you on the pavement he said immediately
you 're the gentleman that bought the young lady 's keepsake album
that was a beautiful bit of paper that was
cream-laid it used to be called
there 's been no paper like that made for - oh i dare say fifty years
he peered at winston over the top of his spectacles
is there anything special i can do for you ?
or did you just want to look round ?
i was passing said winston vaguely
i just looked in
i don't want anything in particular
it 's just as well said the other because i don't suppose i could have satisfied you
he made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand
you see how it is ; an empty shop you might say
between you and me the antique trade 's just about finished
no demand any longer and no stock either
furniture china glass it 's all been broken up by degrees
and of course the metal stuff 's mostly been melted down
i haven't seen a brass candlestick in years
the tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value
the floorspace was very restricted because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture-frames
in the window there were trays of nuts and bolts worn-out chisels penknives with broken blades tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order and other miscellaneous rubbish
only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends - lacquered snuffboxes agate brooches and the like - which looked as though they might include something interesting
as winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight and he picked it up
it was a heavy lump of glass curved on one side flat on the other making almost a hemisphere
there was a peculiar softness as of rainwater in both the colour and the texture of the glass
at the heart of it magnified by the curved surface there was a strange pink convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone
what is it ?
said winston fascinated
that 's coral that is said the old man
it must have come from the indian ocean
they used to kind of embed it in the glass
that wasn't made less than a hundred years ago
more by the look of it
it 's a beautiful thing said winston
it is a beautiful thing said the other appreciatively
but there 's not many that 'd say so nowadays
he coughed
now if it so happened that you wanted to buy it that 'd cost you four dollars
i can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds and eight pounds was - well i can't work it out but it was a lot of money
but who cares about genuine antiques nowadays even the few that 's left ?
winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket
what appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one
the soft rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen
the thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight
it was very heavy in his pocket but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge
it was a queer thing even a compromising thing for a party member to have in his possession
anything old and for that matter anything beautiful was always vaguely suspect
the old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars
winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two
there 's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at he said
there 's not much in it
just a few pieces
we 'll do with a light if we 're going upstairs
he lit another lamp and with bowed back led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots
winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in
there was a strip of carpet on the floor a picture or two on the walls and a deep slatternly arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace
an old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece
under the window and occupying nearly a quarter of the room was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it
we lived here till my wife died said the old man half apologetically
i 'm selling the furniture off by little and little
now that 's a beautiful mahogany bed or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it
but i dare say you 'd find it a little bit cumbersome
he was holding the lamp high up so as to illuminate the whole room and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting
the thought flitted through winston 's mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week if he dared to take the risk
it was a wild impossible notion to be abandoned as soon as thought of ; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia a sort of ancestral memory
it seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob ; utterly alone utterly secure with nobody watching you no voice pursuing you no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock
there 's no telescreen ! he could not help murmuring
ah said the old man i never had one of those things
too expensive
and i never seemed to feel the need of it somehow
now that 's a nice gateleg table in the corner there
though of course you 'd have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps
there was a small bookcase in the other corner and winston had already gravitated towards it
it contained nothing but rubbish
the hunting-down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else
it was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960
the old man still carrying the lamp was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace opposite the bed
now if you happen to be interested in old prints at all - he began delicately
winston came across to examine the picture
it was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows and a small tower in front
there was a railing running round the building and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue
winston gazed at it for some moments
it seemed vaguely familiar though he did not remember the statue
the frame 's fixed to the wall said the old man but i could unscrew it for you i dare say
i know that building said winston finally
it 's a ruin now
it 's in the middle of the street outside the palace of justice
that 's right
outside the law courts
it was bombed in - oh many years ago
it was a church at one time st clement danes its name was
he smiled apologetically as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous and added : oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement 's !
what 's that ?
said winston
oh - oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement 's
that was a rhyme we had when i was a little boy
how it goes on i don't remember but i do know it ended up here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head
it was a kind of a dance
they held out their arms for you to pass under and when they came to here comes a chopper to chop off your head they brought their arms down and caught you
it was just names of churches
all the london churches were in it - all the principal ones that is
winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged
it was always difficult to determine the age of a london building
anything large and impressive if it was reasonably new in appearance was automatically claimed as having been built since the revolution while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the middle ages
the centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value
one could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books
statues inscriptions memorial stones the names of streets - anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered
i never knew it had been a church he said
there 's a lot of them left really said the old man though they 've been put to other uses
now how did that rhyme go ?
ah !
i 've got it !
there now that 's as far as i can get
a farthing that was a small copper coin looked something like a cent
where was st martin 's ?
said winston
st martin 's ?
that 's still standing
it 's in victory square alongside the picture gallery
a building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front and a big flight of steps
winston knew the place well
it was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds - scale models of rocket bombs and floating fortresses waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities and the like
st martin's-in-the-fields it used to be called supplemented the old man though i don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts
winston did not buy the picture
it would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight and impossible to carry home unless it were taken out of its frame
but he lingered for some minutes more talking to the old man whose name he discovered was not weeks - as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shop-front - but charrington
mr charrington it seemed was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years
throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window but had never quite got to the point of doing it
all the while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through winston 's head
oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement 's you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martin 's !
it was curious but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells the bells of a lost london that still existed somewhere or other disguised and forgotten
from one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth
yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing
he got away from mr charrington and went down the stairs alone so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door
he had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval - a month say - he would take the risk of visiting the shop again
it was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the centre
the serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted
however - !
yes he thought again he would come back
he would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish
he would buy the engraving of st clement danes take it out of its frame and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls
he would drag the rest of that poem out of mr charrington 's memory
even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again
for perhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window
he had even started humming to an improvised tune
oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement 's
you owe me three farthings say the
suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water
a figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement not ten metres away
it was the girl from the fiction department the girl with dark hair
the light was failing but there was no difficulty in recognizing her
she looked him straight in the face then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him
for a few seconds winston was too paralysed to move
then he turned to the right and walked heavily away not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction
at any rate one question was settled
there was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him
she must have followed him here because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet kilometres distant from any quarter where party members lived
it was too great a coincidence
whether she was really an agent of the thought police or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness hardly mattered
it was enough that she was watching him
probably she had seen him go into the pub as well
it was an effort to walk
the lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away
the worst thing was the pain in his belly
for a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon
but there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this
then the spasm passed leaving a dull ache behind
the street was a blind alley
winston halted stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do then turned round and began to retrace his steps
as he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her
he could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone
the piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job
but he abandoned the idea immediately because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable
he could not run he could not strike a blow
besides she was young and lusty and would defend herself
he thought also of hurrying to the community centre and staying there till the place closed so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening
but that too was impossible
a deadly lassitude had taken hold of him
all he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet
it was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat
the lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty
he went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of victory gin
then he went to the table in the alcove sat down and took the diary out of the drawer
but he did not open it at once
from the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song
he sat staring at the marbled cover of the book trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness
it was at night that they came for you always at night
the proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you
undoubtedly some people did so
many of the disappearances were actually suicides
but it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms or any quick and certain poison were completely unprocurable
he thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed
he might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough : but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act
it struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy but always against one 's own body
even now in spite of the gin the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible
and it is the same he perceived in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations
on the battlefield in the torture chamber on a sinking ship the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten because the body swells up until it fills the universe and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness against a sour stomach or an aching tooth
he opened the diary
it was important to write something down
the woman on the telescreen had started a new song
her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass
he tried to think of o'brien for whom or to whom the diary was written but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the thought police took him away
it would not matter if they killed you at once
to be killed was what you expected
but before death ( nobody spoke of such things yet everybody knew of them ) there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through : the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy the crack of broken bones the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair
why did you have to endure it since the end was always the same ?
why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life ?
nobody ever escaped detection and nobody ever failed to confess
when once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead
why then did that horror which altered nothing have to lie embedded in future time ?
he tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of o'brien
we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness o'brien had said to him
he knew what it meant or thought he knew
the place where there is no darkness was the imagined future which one would never see but which by foreknowledge one could mystically share in
but with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further
he put a cigarette in his mouth
half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again
the face of big brother swam into his mind displacing that of o'brien
just as he had done a few days earlier he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it
the face gazed up at him heavy calm protecting : but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache ?
like a leaden knell the words came back at him : war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
it was the middle of the morning and winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory
a solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long brightly-lit corridor
it was the girl with dark hair
four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop
as she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls
probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were roughed in
it was a common accident in the fiction department
they were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face
a sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her
she must have fallen right on the injured arm
winston stopped short
the girl had risen to her knees
her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever
her eyes were fixed on his with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain
a curious emotion stirred in winston 's heart
in front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him : in front of him also was a human creature in pain and perhaps with a broken bone
already he had instinctively started forward to help her
in the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body
you 're hurt ?
he said
it 's nothing
my arm
it 'll be all right in a second
she spoke as though her heart were fluttering
she had certainly turned very pale
you haven't broken anything ?
no i 'm all right
it hurt for a moment that 's all
she held out her free hand to him and he helped her up
she had regained some of her colour and appeared very much better
it 's nothing she repeated shortly
i only gave my wrist a bit of a bang
thanks comrade !
and with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going as briskly as though it had really been nothing
the whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute
not to let one 's feelings appear in one 's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened
nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand
there was no question that she had done it intentionally
it was something small and flat
as he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers
it was a scrap of paper folded into a square
while he stood at the urinal he managed with a little more fingering to get it unfolded
obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it
for a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets and read it at once
but that would be shocking folly as he well knew
there was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously
he went back to his cubicle sat down threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him five minutes he told himself five minutes at the very least !
his heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness
fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine the rectification of a long list of figures not needing close attention
whatever was written on the paper it must have some kind of political meaning
so far as he could see there were two possibilities
one much the more likely was that the girl was an agent of the thought police just as he had feared
he did not know why the thought police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion but perhaps they had their reasons
the thing that was written on the paper might be a threat a summons an order to commit suicide a trap of some description
but there was another wilder possibility that kept raising its head though he tried vainly to suppress it
this was that the message did not come from the thought police at all but from some kind of underground organization
perhaps the brotherhood existed after all !
perhaps the girl was part of it !
no doubt the idea was absurd but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand
it was not till a couple of minutes later that the other more probable explanation had occurred to him
and even now though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death - still that was not what he believed and the unreasonable hope persisted and his heart banged and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite
he rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube
eight minutes had gone by
he re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose sighed and drew the next batch of work towards him with the scrap of paper on top of it
he flattened it out
on it was written in a large unformed handwriting : i love you
for several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole
when he did so although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest he could not resist reading it once again just to make sure that the words were really there
for the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work
what was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen
he felt as though a fire were burning in his belly
lunch in the hot crowded noise-filled canteen was torment
he had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour but as bad luck would have it the imbecile parsons flopped down beside him the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for hate week
he was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of big brother 's head two metres wide which was being made for the occasion by his daughter 's troop of spies
the irritating thing was that in the racket of voices winston could hardly hear what parsons was saying and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated
just once he caught a glimpse of the girl at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room
she appeared not to have seen him and he did not look in that direction again
the afternoon was more bearable
immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside
it consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the inner party who was now under a cloud
this was the kind of thing that winston was good at and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether
then the memory of her face came back and with it a raging intolerable desire to be alone
until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new development out
tonight was one of his nights at the community centre
he wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen hurried off to the centre took part in the solemn foolery of a discussion group played two games of table tennis swallowed several glasses of gin and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled ingsoc in relation to chess
his soul writhed with boredom but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the centre
at the sight of the words i love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid
it was not till twenty-three hours when he was home and in bed - in the darkness where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent - that he was able to think continuously
it was a physical problem that had to be solved : how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting
he did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him
he knew that it was not so because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note
obviously she had been frightened out of her wits as well she might be
nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind
only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone but that was of no importance
he thought of her naked youthful body as he had seen it in his dream
he had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them her head stuffed with lies and hatred her belly full of ice
a kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her the white youthful body might slip away from him !
what he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly
but the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous
it was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated
whichever way you turned the telescreen faced you
actually all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note ; but now with time to think he went over them one by one as though laying out a row of instruments on a table
obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated
if she had worked in the records department it might have been comparatively simple but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the fiction department lay and he had no pretext for going there
if he had known where she lived and at what time she left work he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home ; but to try to follow her home was not safe because it would mean loitering about outside the ministry which was bound to be noticed
as for sending a letter through the mails it was out of the question
by a routine that was not even secret all letters were opened in transit
actually few people ever wrote letters
for the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable
in any case he did not know the girl 's name let alone her address
finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen
if he could get her at a table by herself somewhere in the middle of the room not too near the telescreens and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round - if these conditions endured for say thirty seconds it might be possible to exchange a few words
for a week after this life was like a restless dream
on the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it the whistle having already blown
presumably she had been changed on to a later shift
they passed each other without a glance
on the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen
then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all
his whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity a sort of transparency which made every movement every sound every contact every word that he had to speak or listen to an agony
even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image
he did not touch the diary during those days
if there was any relief it was in his work in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch
he had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her
there was no enquiry he could make
she might have been vaporized she might have committed suicide she might have been transferred to the other end of oceania : worst and likeliest of all she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him
the next day she reappeared
her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist
the relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds
on the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her
when he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall and was quite alone
it was early and the place was not very full
the queue edged forward till winston was almost at the counter then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine
but the girl was still alone when winston secured his tray and began to make for her table
he walked casually towards her his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her
she was perhaps three metres away from him
another two seconds would do it
then a voice behind him called smith !
he pretended not to hear
smith ! repeated the voice more loudly
it was no use
he turned round
a blond-headed silly-faced young man named wilsher whom he barely knew was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table
it was not safe to refuse
after having been recognized he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl
it was too noticeable
he sat down with a friendly smile
the silly blond face beamed into his
winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it
the girl 's table filled up a few minutes later
but she must have seen him coming towards her and perhaps she would take the hint
next day he took care to arrive early
surely enough she was at a table in about the same place and again alone
the person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small swiftly-moving beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny suspicious eyes
as winston turned away from the counter with his tray he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl 's table
his hopes sank again
there was a vacant place at a table further away but something in the little man 's appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table
with ice at his heart winston followed
it was no use unless he could get the girl alone
at this moment there was a tremendous crash
the little man was sprawling on all fours his tray had gone flying two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor
he started to his feet with a malignant glance at winston whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up
but it was all right
five seconds later with a thundering heart winston was sitting at the girl 's table
he did not look at her
he unpacked his tray and promptly began eating
it was all-important to speak at once before anyone else came but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him
a week had gone by since she had first approached him
she would have changed her mind she must have changed her mind !
it was impossible that this affair should end successfully ; such things did not happen in real life
he might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen ampleforth the hairy-eared poet wandering limply round the room with a tray looking for a place to sit down
in his vague way ampleforth was attached to winston and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him
there was perhaps a minute in which to act
both winston and the girl were eating steadily
the stuff they were eating was a thin stew actually a soup of haricot beans
in a low murmur winston began speaking
neither of them looked up ; steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices
what time do you leave work ?
eighteen-thirty
where can we meet ?
victory square near the monument
it 's full of telescreens
it doesn't matter if there 's a crowd
any signal ?
no
don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people
and don't look at me
just keep somewhere near me
what time ?
nineteen hours
all right
ampleforth failed to see winston and sat down at another table
they did not speak again and so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table they did not look at one another
the girl finished her lunch quickly and made off while winston stayed to smoke a cigarette
winston was in victory square before the appointed time
he wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column at the top of which big brother 's statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the eurasian aeroplanes ( the eastasian aeroplanes it had been a few years ago ) in the battle of airstrip one
in the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent oliver cromwell
at five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared
again the terrible fear seized upon winston
she was not coming she had changed her mind !
he walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying st martin 's church whose bells when it had bells had chimed you owe me three farthings
then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column
it was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated
there were telescreens all round the pediment
but at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left
suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square
the girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush
winston followed
as he ran he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of eurasian prisoners was passing
already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square
winston at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage shoved butted squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd
soon he was within arm 's length of the girl but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman presumably his wife who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh
winston wriggled himself sideways and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them
for a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips then he had broken through sweating a little
he was next to the girl
they were shoulder to shoulder both staring fixedly in front of them
a long line of trucks with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machine guns standing upright in each corner was passing slowly down the street
in the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting jammed close together
their sad mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks utterly incurious
occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clankclank of metal : all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons
truckload after truck-load of the sad faces passed
winston knew they were there but he saw them only intermittently
the girl 's shoulder and her arm right down to the elbow were pressed against his
her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth
she had immediately taken charge of the situation just as she had done in the canteen
she began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before with lips barely moving a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks
can you hear me ?
yes
can you get sunday afternoon off ?
yes
then listen carefully
you 'll have to remember this
go to paddington station -
with a sort of military precision that astonished him she outlined the route that he was to follow
a half-hour railway journey ; turn left outside the station ; two kilometres along the road : a gate with the top bar missing ; a path across a field ; a grass-grown lane ; a track between bushes ; a dead tree with moss on it
it was as though she had a map inside her head
can you remember all that ?
she murmured finally
yes
you turn left then right then left again
and the gate 's got no top bar
yes
what time ?
about fifteen
you may have to wait
i 'll get there by another way
are you sure you remember everything ?
yes
then get away from me as quick as you can
she need not have told him that
but for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd
the trucks were still filing post the people still insatiably gaping
at the start there had been a few boos and hisses but it came only from the party members among the crowd and had soon stopped
the prevailing emotion was simply curiosity
foreigners whether from eurasia or from eastasia were a kind of strange animal
one literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them
nor did one know what became of them apart from the few who were hanged as war-criminals : the others simply vanished presumably into forced-labour camps
the round mongol faces had given way to faces of a more european type dirty bearded and exhausted
from over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into winston 's sometimes with strange intensity and flashed away again
the convoy was drawing to an end
in the last truck he could see an aged man his face a mass of grizzled hair standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him as though he were used to having them bound together
it was almost time for winston and the girl to part
but at the last moment while the crowd still hemmed them in her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze
it could not have been ten seconds and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together
he had time to learn every detail of her hand
he explored the long fingers the shapely nails the work-hardened palm with its row of callouses the smooth flesh under the wrist
merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight
in the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl 's eyes were
they were probably brown but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes
to turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly
with hands locked together invisible among the press of bodies they stared steadily in front of them and instead of the eyes of the girl the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at winston out of nests of hair
winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted
under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells
the air seemed to kiss one 's skin
it was the second of may
from somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves
he was a bit early
there had been no difficulties about the journey and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been
presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place
in general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in london
there were no telescreens of course but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized ; besides it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention
for distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations who examined the papers of any party member they found there and asked awkward questions
however no patrols had appeared and on the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed
the train was full of proles in holiday mood because of the summery weather
the wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family ranging from a toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby going out to spend an afternoon with in-laws in the country and as they freely explained to winston to get hold of a little blackmarket butter
the lane widened and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes
he had no watch but it could not be fifteen yet
the bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them
he knelt down and began picking some partly to pass the time away but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met
he had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs
he went on picking bluebells
it was the best thing to do
it might be the girl or he might have been followed after all
to look round was to show guilt
he picked another and another
a hand fell lightly on his shoulder
he looked up
it was the girl
she shook her head evidently as a warning that he must keep silent then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood
obviously she had been that way before for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit
winston followed still clasping his bunch of flowers
his first feeling was relief but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him
even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back after all
the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him
already on the walk from the station the may sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated a creature of indoors with the sooty dust of london in the pores of his skin
it occurred to him that till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open
they came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of
the girl hopped over and forced apart the bushes in which there did not seem to be an opening
when winston followed her he found that they were in a natural clearing a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely
the girl stopped and turned
here we are she said
he was facing her at several paces ' distance
as yet he did not dare move nearer to her
i didn't want to say anything in the lane she went on in case there 's a mike hidden there
i don't suppose there is but there could be
there 's always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice
we 're all right here
he still had not the courage to approach her
we 're all right here ?
he repeated stupidly
yes
look at the trees
they were small ashes which at some time had been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles none of them thicker than one 's wrist
there 's nothing big enough to hide a mike in
besides i 've been here before
they were only making conversation
he had managed to move closer to her now
she stood before him very upright with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act
the bluebells had cascaded on to the ground
they seemed to have fallen of their own accord
he took her hand
would you believe he said that till this moment i didn't know what colour your eyes were ?
they were brown he noted a rather light shade of brown with dark lashes
now that you 've seen what i 'm really like can you still bear to look at me ?
yes easily
i 'm thirty-nine years old
i 've got a wife that i can't get rid of
i 've got varicose veins
i 've got five false teeth
i couldn't care less said the girl
the next moment it was hard to say by whose act she was in his his arms
at the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity
the youthful body was strained against his own the mass of dark hair was against his face and yes ! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth
she had clasped her arms about his neck she was calling him darling precious one loved one
he had pulled her down on to the ground she was utterly unresisting he could do what he liked with her
but the truth was that he had no physical sensation except that of mere contact
all he felt was incredulity and pride
he was glad that this was happening but he had no physical desire
it was too soon her youth and prettiness had frightened him he was too much used to living without women - he did not know the reason
the girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair
she sat against him putting her arm round his waist
never mind dear
there 's no hurry
we 've got the whole afternoon
isn't this a splendid hide-out ?
i found it when i got lost once on a community hike
if anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away
what is your name ?
said winston
julia
i know yours
it 's winston - winston smith
how did you find that out ?
i expect i 'm better at finding things out than you are dear
tell me what did you think of me before that day i gave you the note ?
he did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her
it was even a sort of love-offering to start off by telling the worst
i hated the sight of you he said
i wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards
two weeks ago i thought seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone
if you really want to know i imagined that you had something to do with the thought police
the girl laughed delightedly evidently taking this as a tribute to the excellence of her disguise
not the thought police !
you didn't honestly think that ?
well perhaps not exactly that
but from your general appearance - merely because you 're young and fresh and healthy you understand - i thought that probably -
you thought i was a good party member
pure in word and deed
banners processions slogans games community hikes all that stuff
and you thought that if i had a quarter of a chance i 'd denounce you as a thought-criminal and get you killed off ?
yes something of that kind
a great many young girls are like that you know
it 's this bloody thing that does it she said ripping off the scarlet sash of the junior anti-sex league and flinging it on to a bough
then as though touching her waist had reminded her of something she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate
she broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to winston
even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate
it was dark and shiny and was wrapped in silver paper
chocolate normally was dullbrown crumbly stuff that tasted as nearly as one could describe it like the smoke of a rubbish fire
but at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him
the first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down but which was powerful and troubling
where did you get this stuff ?
he said
black market she said indifferently
actually i am that sort of girl to look at
i 'm good at games
i was a troop-leader in the spies
i do voluntary work three evenings a week for the junior anti-sex league
hours and hours i 've spent pasting their bloody rot all over london
i always carry one end of a banner in the processions
i always look cheerful and i never shirk anything
always yell with the crowd that 's what i say
it 's the only way to be safe
the first fragment of chocolate had melted on winston 's tongue
the taste was delightful
but there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape like an object seen out of the corner of one 's eye
he pushed it away from him aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not
you are very young he said
you are ten or fifteen years younger than i am
what could you see to attract you in a man like me ?
it was something in your face
i thought i 'd take a chance
i 'm good at spotting people who don't belong
as soon as i saw you i knew you were against them
them it appeared meant the party and above all the inner party about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made winston feel uneasy although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere
a thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language
party members were supposed not to swear and winston himself very seldom did swear aloud at any rate
julia however seemed unable to mention the party and especially the inner party without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways
he did not dislike it
it was merely one symptom of her revolt against the party and all its ways and somehow it seemed natural and healthy like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay
they had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade with their arms round each other 's waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast
he noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone
they did not speak above a whisper
outside the clearing julia said it was better to go quietly
presently they had reached the edge of the little wood
she stopped him
don't go out into the open
there might be someone watching
we 're all right if we keep behind the boughs
they were standing in the shade of hazel bushes
the sunlight filtering through innumerable leaves was still hot on their faces
winston looked out into the field beyond and underwent a curious slow shock of recognition
he knew it by sight
an old closebitten pasture with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there
in the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women 's hair
surely somewhere nearby but out of sight there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming ?
isn't there a stream somewhere near here ?
he whispered
that 's right there is a stream
it 's at the edge of the next field actually
there are fish in it great big ones
you can watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees waving their tails
it 's the golden country - almost he murmured
the golden country ?
it 's nothing really
a landscape i 've seen sometimes in a dream
look ! whispered julia
a thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away almost at the level of their faces
perhaps it had not seen them
it was in the sun they in the shade
it spread out its wings fitted them carefully into place again ducked its head for a moment as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun and then began to pour forth a torrent of song
in the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling
winston and julia clung together fascinated
the music went on and on minute after minute with astonishing variations never once repeating itself almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity
sometimes it stopped for a few seconds spread out and resettled its wings then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song
winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence
for whom for what was that bird singing ?
no mate no rival was watching it
what made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness ?
he wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near
he and julia had spoken only in low whispers and it would not pick up what they had said but it would pick up the thrush
perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small beetle-like man was listening intently - listening to that
but by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind
it was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves
he stopped thinking and merely felt
the girl 's waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm
he pulled her round so that they were breast to breast ; her body seemed to melt into his
wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as water
their mouths clung together ; it was quite different from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier
when they moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply
the bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings
winston put his lips against her ear
now he whispered
not here she whispered back
come back to the hide-out
it 's safer
quickly with an occasional crackle of twigs they threaded their way back to the clearing
when they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him
they were both breathing fast but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth
she stood looking at him for an instant then felt at the zipper of her overalls
and yes ! it was almost as in his dream
almost as swiftly as he had imagined it she had torn her clothes off and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated
her body gleamed white in the sun
but for a moment he did not look at her body ; his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint bold smile
he knelt down before her and took her hands in his
have you done this before ?
of course
hundreds of times - well scores of times anyway
with party members ?
yes always with party members
with members of the inner party ?
not with those swine no
but there 's plenty that would if they got half a chance
they 're not so holy as they make out
his heart leapt
scores of times she had done it : he wished it had been hundreds - thousands
anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope
who knew perhaps the party was rotten under the surface its cult of strenuousness and selfdenial simply a sham concealing iniquity
if he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis how gladly he would have done so !
anything to rot to weaken to undermine !
he pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face
listen
the more men you 've had the more i love you
do you understand that ?
yes perfectly
i hate purity i hate goodness !
i don't want any virtue to exist anywhere
i want everyone to be corrupt to the bones
well then i ought to suit you dear
i 'm corrupt to the bones
you like doing this ?
i don't mean simply me : i mean the thing in itself ?
i adore it
that was above all what he wanted to hear
not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct the simple undifferentiated desire : that was the force that would tear the party to pieces
he pressed her down upon the grass among the fallen bluebells
this time there was no difficulty
presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart
the sun seemed to have grown hotter
they were both sleepy
he reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her
almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour
winston woke first
he sat up and watched the freckled face still peacefully asleep pillowed on the palm of her hand
except for her mouth you could not call her beautiful
there was a line or two round the eyes if you looked closely
the short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft
it occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived
the young strong body now helpless in sleep awoke in him a pitying protecting feeling
but the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree while the thrush was singing had not quite come back
he pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank
in the old days he thought a man looked at a girl 's body and saw that it was desirable and that was the end of the story
but you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays
no emotion was pure because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred
their embrace had been a battle the climax a victory
it was a blow struck against the party
it was a political act
we can come here once again said julia
it 's generally safe to use any hide-out twice
but not for another month or two of course
as soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed
she became alert and business-like put her clothes on knotted the scarlet sash about her waist and began arranging the details of the journey home
it seemed natural to leave this to her
she obviously had a practical cunning which winston lacked and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round london stored away from innumerable community hikes
the route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come and brought him out at a different railway station
never go home the same way as you went out she said as though enunciating an important general principle
she would leave first and winston was to wait half an hour before following her
she had named a place where they could meet after work four evenings hence
it was a street in one of the poorer quarters where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy
she would be hanging about among the stalls pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing-thread
if she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached ; otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition
but with luck in the middle of the crowd it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting
and now i must go she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions
i 'm due back at nineteen-thirty
i 've got to put in two hours for the junior anti-sex league handing out leaflets or something
isn't it bloody ?
give me a brush-down would you ?
have i got any twigs in my hair ?
are you sure ?
then good-bye my love good-bye !
she flung herself into his arms kissed him almost violently and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise
even now he had not found out her surname or her address
however it made no difference for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication
as it happened they never went back to the clearing in the wood
during the month of may there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love
that was in another hiding-place known to julia the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier
it was a good hiding-place when once you got there but the getting there was very dangerous
for the rest they could meet only in the streets in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time
in the street it was usually possible to talk after a fashion
as they drifted down the crowded pavements not quite abreast and never looking at one another they carried on a curious intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence then abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot then continued almost without introduction on the following day
julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation which she called talking by instalments
she was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips
just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss
they were passing in silence down a side-street ( julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets ) when there was a deafening roar the earth heaved and the air darkened and winston found himself lying on his side bruised and terrified
a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand
suddenly he became aware of julia 's face a few centimetres from his own deathly white as white as chalk
even her lips were white
she was dead !
he clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face
but there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips
both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster
there were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead
even if it had been less dangerous it would still have been difficult to find time to meet
winston 's working week was sixty hours julia 's was even longer and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide
julia in any case seldom had an evening completely free
she spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations distributing literature for the junior anti-sex league preparing banners for hate week making collections for the savings campaign and such-like activities
it paid she said it was camouflage
if you kept the small rules you could break the big ones
she even induced winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous party members
so one evening every week winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses in a draughty ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens
when they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up
it was a blazing afternoon
the air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung
they sat talking for hours on the dusty twig-littered floor one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming
julia was twenty-six years old
she lived in a hostel with thirty other girls ( always in the stink of women !
how i hate women ! she said parenthetically ) and she worked as he had guessed on the novel-writing machines in the fiction department
she enjoyed her work which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor
she was not clever but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery
she could describe the whole process of composing a novel from the general directive issued by the planning committee down to the final touching-up by the rewrite squad
but she was not interested in the finished product
she didn't much care for reading she said
books were just a commodity that had to be produced like jam or bootlaces
she had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight
at school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running
she had been a troop-leader in the spies and a branch secretary in the youth league before joining the junior anti-sex league
she had always borne an excellent character
she had even ( an infallible mark of good reputation ) been picked out to work in pornosec the sub-section of the fiction department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles
it was nicknamed muck house by the people who worked in it she remarked
there she had remained for a year helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like spanking stories or one night in a girls ' school to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal
what are these books like ?
said winston curiously
oh ghastly rubbish
they 're boring really
they only have six plots but they swap them round a bit
of course i was only on the kaleidoscopes
i was never in the rewrite squad
i 'm not literary dear - not even enough for that
he learned with astonishment that all the workers in pornosec except the heads of the departments were girls
the theory was that men whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled
they don't even like having married women there she added
girls are always supposed to be so pure
here 's one who isn't anyway
she had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen with a party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest
and a good job too said julia otherwise they 'd have had my name out of him when he confessed
since then there had been various others
life as she saw it was quite simple
you wanted a good time ; they meaning the party wanted to stop you having it ; you broke the rules as best you could
she seemed to think it just as natural that they should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught
she hated the party and said so in the crudest words but she made no general criticism of it
except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in party doctrine
he noticed that she never used newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use
she had never heard of the brotherhood and refused to believe in its existence
any kind of organized revolt against the party which was bound to be a failure struck her as stupid
the clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same
he wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the revolution knowing nothing else accepting the party as something unalterable like the sky not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it as a rabbit dodges a dog
they did not discuss the possibility of getting married
it was too remote to be worth thinking about
no imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if katharine winston 's wife could somehow have been got rid of
it was hopeless even as a daydream
what was she like your wife ?
said julia
she was - do you know the newspeak word goodthinkful ?
meaning naturally orthodox incapable of thinking a bad thought ?
no i didn't know the word but i know the kind of person right enough
he began telling her the story of his married life but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already
she described to him almost as though she had seen or felt it the stiffening of katharine 's body as soon as he touched her the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength even when her arms were clasped tightly round him
with julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things : katharine in any case had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one
i could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing he said
he told her about the frigid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week
she hated it but nothing would make her stop doing it
she used to call it - but you 'll never guess
our duty to the party said julia promptly
how did you know that ?
i 've been at school too dear
sex talks once a month for the over-sixteens
and in the youth movement
they rub it into you for years
i dare say it works in a lot of cases
but of course you can never tell ; people are such hypocrites
she began to enlarge upon the subject
with julia everything came back to her own sexuality
as soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness
unlike winston she had grasped the inner meaning of the party 's sexual puritanism
it was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the party 's control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible
what was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria which was desirable because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship
the way she put it was :
when you make love you 're using up energy ; and afterwards you feel happy and don't give a damn for anything
they can't bear you to feel like that
they want you to be bursting with energy all the time
all this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour
if you 're happy inside yourself why should you get excited about big brother and the three-year plans and the two minutes hate and all the rest of their bloody rot ?
that was very true he thought
there was a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy
for how could the fear the hatred and the lunatic credulity which the party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force ?
the sex impulse was dangerous to the party and the party had turned it to account
they had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood
the family could not actually be abolished and indeed people were encouraged to be fond of their children in almost the old-fashioned way
the children on the other hand were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations
the family had become in effect an extension of the thought police
it was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately
abruptly his mind went back to katharine
katharine would unquestionably have denounced him to the thought police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions
but what really recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon which had brought the sweat out on his forehead
he began telling julia of something that had happened or rather had failed to happen on another sweltering summer afternoon eleven years ago
it was three or four months after they were married
they had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in kent
they had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes but they took a wrong turning and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry
it was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres with boulders at the bottom
there was nobody of whom they could ask the way
as soon as she realized that they were lost katharine became very uneasy
to be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrong-doing
she wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction
but at this moment winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them
one tuft was of two colours magenta and brick-red apparently growing on the same root
he had never seen anything of the kind before and he called to katharine to come and look at it
look katharine !
look at those flowers
that clump down near the bottom
do you see they 're two different colours ?
she had already turned to go but she did rather fretfully come back for a moment
she even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was pointing
he was standing a little behind her and he put his hand on her waist to steady her
at this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were
there was not a human creature anywhere not a leaf stirring not even a bird awake
in a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very small and even if there was a microphone it would only pick up sounds
it was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon
the sun blazed down upon them the sweat tickled his face
and the thought struck him .
why didn't you give her a good shove ?
said julia
i would have
yes dear you would have
i would if i 'd been the same person then as i am now
or perhaps i would - i 'm not certain
are you sorry you didn't ?
yes
on the whole i 'm sorry i didn't
they were sitting side by side on the dusty floor
he pulled her closer against him
her head rested on his shoulder the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung
she was very young he thought she still expected something from life she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing
actually it would have made no difference he said
then why are you sorry you didn't do it ?
only because i prefer a positive to a negative
in this game that we 're playing we can't win
some kinds of failure are better than other kinds that 's all
he felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent
she always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind
she would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated
in a way she realized that she herself was doomed that sooner or later the thought police would catch her and kill her but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose
all you needed was luck and cunning and boldness
she did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness that the only victory lay in the far future long after you were dead that from the moment of declaring war on the party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse
we are the dead he said
we 're not dead yet said julia prosaically
not physically
six months a year - five years conceivably
i am afraid of death
you are young so presumably you 're more afraid of it than i am
obviously we shall put it off as long as we can
but it makes very little difference
so long as human beings stay human death and life are the same thing
oh rubbish !
which would you sooner sleep with me or a skeleton ?
don't you enjoy being alive ?
don't you like feeling : this is me this is my hand this is my leg i 'm real i 'm solid i 'm alive !
don't you like this ?
she twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him
he could feel her breasts ripe yet firm through her overalls
her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth and vigour into his
yes i like that he said
then stop talking about dying
and now listen dear we 've got to fix up about the next time we meet
we may as well go back to the place in the wood
we 've given it a good long rest
but you must get there by a different way this time
i 've got it all planned out
you take the train - but look i 'll draw it out for you
and in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust and with a twig from a pigeon 's nest began drawing a map on the floor
winston looked round the shabby little room above mr charrington 's shop
beside the window the enormous bed was made up with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster
the old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece
in the corner on the gateleg table the glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness
in the fender was a battered tin oilstove a saucepan and two cups provided by mr charrington
winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil
he had brought an envelope full of victory coffee and some saccharine tablets
the clock 's hands said seventeen-twenty : it was nineteen-twenty really
she was coming at nineteen-thirty
folly folly his heart kept saying : conscious gratuitous suicidal folly
of all the crimes that a party member could commit this one was the least possible to conceal
actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table
as he had foreseen mr charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room
he was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him
nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love-affair
instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in generalities with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible
privacy he said was a very valuable thing
everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally
and when they had such a place it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself
he even seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so added that there were two entries to the house one of them through the back yard which gave on an alley
under the window somebody was singing
winston peeped out secure in the protection of the muslin curtain
the june sun was still high in the sky and in the sun-filled court below a monstrous woman solid as a norman pillar with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line pegging out a series of square white things which winston recognized as babies ' diapers
whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto :
the tune had been haunting london for weeks past
it was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub-section of the music department
the words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator
but the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound
he could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones and the cries of the children in the street and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic and yet the room seemed curiously silent thanks to the absence of a telescreen
folly folly folly ! he thought again
it was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught
but the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own indoors and near at hand had been too much for both of them
for some time after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings
working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of hate week
it was more than a month distant but the enormous complex preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody
finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day
they had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood
on the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street
as usual winston hardly looked at julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual
it 's all off she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak
tomorrow i mean
what ?
tomorrow afternoon
i can't come
why not ?
oh the usual reason
it 's started early this time
for a moment he was violently angry
during the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed
at the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it
their first love-making had been simply an act of the will
but after the second time it was different
the smell of her hair the taste of her mouth the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him or into the air all round him
she had become a physical necessity something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to
when she said that she could not come he had the feeling that she was cheating him
but just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met
she gave the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection
it struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal recurring event ; and a deep tenderness such as he had not felt for her before suddenly took hold of him
he wished that they were a married couple of ten years ' standing
he wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household
he wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met
it was not actually at that moment but at some time on the following day that the idea of renting mr charrington 's room had occurred to him
when he suggested it to julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness
both of them knew that it was lunacy
it was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves
as he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of love
it was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one 's consciousness
there it lay fixed in future times preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100
one could not avoid it but one could perhaps postpone it : and yet instead every now and again by a conscious wilful act one chose to shorten the interval before it happened
at this moment there was a quick step on the stairs
julia burst into the room
she was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the ministry
he started forward to take her in his arms but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly partly because she was still holding the tool-bag
half a second she said
just let me show you what i 've brought
did you bring some of that filthy victory coffee ?
i thought you would
you can chuck it away again because we shan't be needing it
look here
she fell on her knees threw open the bag and tumbled out some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it
underneath were a number of neat paper packets
the first packet that she passed to winston had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling
it was filled with some kind of heavy sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it
it isn't sugar ?
he said
real sugar
not saccharine sugar
and here 's a loaf of bread proper white bread not our bloody stuff - and a little pot of jam
and here 's a tin of milk - but look !
this is the one i 'm really proud of
i had to wrap a bit of sacking round it because -
but she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up
the smell was already filling the room a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood but which one did occasionally meet with even now blowing down a passage-way before a door slammed or diffusing itself mysteriously in a crowded street sniffed for an instant and then lost again
it 's coffee he murmured real coffee
it 's inner party coffee
there 's a whole kilo here she said
how did you manage to get hold of all these things ?
it 's all inner party stuff
there 's nothing those swine don't have nothing
but of course waiters and servants and people pinch things and - look i got a little packet of tea as well
winston had squatted down beside her
he tore open a corner of the packet
it 's real tea
not blackberry leaves
there 's been a lot of tea about lately
they 've captured india or something she said vaguely
but listen dear
i want you to turn your back on me for three minutes
go and sit on the other side of the bed
don't go too near the window
and don't turn round till i tell you
winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain
down in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and the line
she took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling :
she knew the whole drivelling song by heart it seemed
her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air very tuneful charged with a sort of happy melancholy
one had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content if the june evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible to remain there for a thousand years pegging out diapers and singing rubbish
it struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the party singing alone and spontaneously
it would even have seemed slightly unorthodox a dangerous eccentricity like talking to oneself
perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about
you can turn round now said julia
he turned round and for a second almost failed to recognize her
what he had actually expected was to see her naked
but she was not naked
the transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that
she had painted her face
she must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of make-up materials
her lips were deeply reddened her cheeks rouged her nose powdered ; there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter
it was not very skilfully done but winston 's standards in such matters were not high
he had never before seen or imagined a woman of the party with cosmetics on her face
the improvement in her appearance was startling
with just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not only very much prettier but above all far more feminine
her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect
as he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils
he remembered the half-darkness of a basement kitchen and a woman 's cavernous mouth
it was the very same scent that she had used ; but at the moment it did not seem to matter
scent too ! he said
yes dear scent too
and do you know what i 'm going to do next ?
i 'm going to get hold of a real woman 's frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers
i 'll wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes !
in this room i 'm going to be a woman not a party comrade
they flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed
it was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence
until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle
there were no sheets but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth and the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them
it 's sure to be full of bugs but who cares ?
said julia
one never saw a double bed nowadays except in the homes of the proles
winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood : julia had never been in one before so far as she could remember
presently they fell asleep for a little while
when winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine
he did not stir because julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm
most of her make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone
a yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace where the water in the pan was boiling fast
down in the yard the woman had stopped singing but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street
he wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this in the cool of a summer evening a man and a woman with no clothes on making love when they chose talking of what they chose not feeling any compulsion to get up simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside
surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary ?
julia woke up rubbed her eyes and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove
half that water 's boiled away she said
i 'll get up and make some coffee in another moment
we 've got an hour
what time do they cut the lights off at your flats ?
twenty-three thirty
it 's twenty-three at the hostel
but you have to get in earlier than that because - hi !
get out you filthy brute !
she suddenly twisted herself over in the bed seized a shoe from the floor and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm exactly as he had seen her fling the dictionary at goldstein that morning during the two minutes hate
what was it ?
he said in surprise
a rat
i saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting
there 's a hole down there
i gave him a good fright anyway
rats ! murmured winston
in this room !
they 're all over the place said julia indifferently as she lay down again
we 've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel
some parts of london are swarming with them
did you know they attack children ?
yes they do
in some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for two minutes
it 's the great huge brown ones that do it
and the nasty thing is that the brutes always -
don't go on ! said winston with his eyes tightly shut
dearest !
you 've gone quite pale
what 's the matter ?
do they make you feel sick ?
of all horrors in the world - a rat !
she pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body
he did not reopen his eyes immediately
for several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life
it was always very much the same
he was standing in front of a wall of darkness and on the other side of it there was something unendurable something too dreadful to be faced
in the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self-deception because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness
with a deadly effort like wrenching a piece out of his own brain he could even have dragged the thing into the open
he always woke up without discovering what it was : but somehow it was connected with what julia had been saying when he cut her short
i 'm sorry he said it 's nothing
i don't like rats that 's all
don't worry dear we 're not going to have the filthy brutes in here
i 'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go
and next time we come here i 'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly
already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten
feeling slightly ashamed of himself he sat up against the bedhead
julia got out of bed pulled on her overalls and made the coffee
the smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive
what was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar a thing winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine
with one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other julia wandered about the room glancing indifferently at the bookcase pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable and examining the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement
she brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light
he took it out of her hand fascinated as always by the soft rainwatery appearance of the glass
what is it do you think ?
said julia
i don't think it 's anything - i mean i don't think it was ever put to any use
that 's what i like about it
it 's a little chunk of history that they 've forgotten to alter
it 's a message from a hundred years ago if one knew how to read it
and that picture over there - she nodded at the engraving on the opposite wall - would that be a hundred years old ?
more
two hundred i dare say
one can't tell
it 's impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays
she went over to look at it
here 's where that brute stuck his nose out she said kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture
what is this place ?
i 've seen it before somewhere
it 's a church or at least it used to be
st clement danes its name was
the fragment of rhyme that mr charrington had taught him came back into his head and he added half-nostalgically : oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement 's !
to his astonishment she capped the line :
you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martin 's
when will you pay me ? say the bells of old bailey -
i can't remember how it goes on after that
but anyway i remember it ends up here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head !
it was like the two halves of a countersign
but there must be another line after the bells of old bailey
perhaps it could be dug out of mr charrington 's memory if he were suitably prompted
who taught you that ?
he said
my grandfather
he used to say it to me when i was a little girl
he was vaporized when i was eight - at any rate he disappeared
i wonder what a lemon was she added inconsequently
i 've seen oranges
they 're a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin
i can remember lemons said winston
they were quite common in the fifties
they were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them
i bet that picture 's got bugs behind it said julia
i 'll take it down and give it a good clean some day
i suppose it 's almost time we were leaving
i must start washing this paint off
what a bore !
i 'll get the lipstick off your face afterwards
winston did not get up for a few minutes more
the room was darkening
he turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight
the inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself
there was such a depth of it and yet it was almost as transparent as air
it was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete
he had the feeling that he could get inside it and that in fact he was inside it along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself
the paperweight was the room he was in and the coral was julia 's life and his own fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal
syme had vanished
a morning came and he was missing from work : a few thoughtless people commented on his absence
on the next day nobody mentioned him
on the third day winston went into the vestibule of the records department to look at the notice-board
one of the notices carried a printed list of the members of the chess committee of whom syme had been one
it looked almost exactly as it had looked before - nothing had been crossed out - but it was one name shorter
it was enough
syme had ceased to exist : he had never existed
the weather was baking hot
in the labyrinthine ministry the windowless air-conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature but outside the pavements scorched one 's feet and the stench of the tubes at the rush hours was a horror
the preparations for hate week were in full swing and the staffs of all the ministries were working overtime
processions meetings military parades lectures waxworks displays film shows telescreen programmes all had to be organized ; stands had to be erected effigies built slogans coined songs written rumours circulated photographs faked
julia 's unit in the fiction department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets
winston in addition to his regular work spent long periods every day in going through back files of the times and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches
late at night when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets the town had a curiously febrile air
the rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever and sometimes in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumours
the new tune which was to be the theme-song of hate week ( the hate song it was called ) had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens
it had a savage barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music but resembled the beating of a drum
roared out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet it was terrifying
the proles had taken a fancy to it and in the midnight streets it competed with the still-popular it was only a hopeless fancy
the parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day unbearably on a comb and a piece of toilet paper
winston 's evenings were fuller than ever
squads of volunteers organized by parsons were preparing the street for hate week stitching banners painting posters erecting flagstaffs on the roofs and perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers
parsons boasted that victory mansions alone would display four hundred metres of bunting
he was in his native element and as happy as a lark
the heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings
he was everywhere at once pushing pulling sawing hammering improvising jollying everyone along with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat
a new poster had suddenly appeared all over london
it had no caption and represented simply the monstrous figure of a eurasian soldier three or four metres high striding forward with expressionless mongolian face and enormous boots a submachine gun pointed from his hip
from whatever angle you looked at the poster the muzzle of the gun magnified by the foreshortening seemed to be pointed straight at you
the thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall even outnumbering the portraits of big brother
the proles normally apathetic about the war were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism
as though to harmonize with the general mood the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual
one fell on a crowded film theatre in stepney burying several hundred victims among the ruins
the whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting
another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces
there were further angry demonstrations goldstein was burned in effigy hundreds of copies of the poster of the eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil ; then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished of suffocation
in the room over mr charrington 's shop when they could get there julia and winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window naked for the sake of coolness
the rat had never come back but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat
it did not seem to matter
dirty or clean the room was paradise
as soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market tear off their clothes and make love with sweating bodies then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack
four five six - seven times they met during the month of june
winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours
he seemed to have lost the need for it
he had grown fatter his varicose ulcer had subsided leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped
the process of life had ceased to be intolerable he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice
now that they had a secure hiding-place almost a home it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time
what mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist
to know that it was there inviolate was almost the same as being in it
the room was a world a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk
mr charrington thought winston was another extinct animal
he usually stopped to talk with mr charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs
the old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors and on the other hand to have almost no customers
he led a ghostlike existence between the tiny dark shop and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which contained among other things an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an enormous horn
he seemed glad of the opportunity to talk
wandering about among his worthless stock with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket he had always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman
with a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that - a china bottle-stopper the painted lid of a broken snuffbox a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby 's hair - never asking that winston should buy it merely that he should admire it
to talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box
he had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes
there was one about four and twenty blackbirds and another about a cow with a crumpled horn and another about the death of poor cock robin
it just occurred to me you might be interested he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment
but he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme
both of them knew - in a way it was never out of their minds that what was now happening could not last long
there were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking
but there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence
so long as they were actually in this room they both felt no harm could come to them
getting there was difficult and dangerous but the room itself was sanctuary
it was as when winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world and that once inside it time could be arrested
often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape
their luck would hold indefinitely and they would carry on their intrigue just like this for the remainder of their natural lives
or katharine would die and by subtle manoeuvrings winston and julia would succeed in getting married
or they would commit suicide together
or they would disappear alter themselves out of recognition learn to speak with proletarian accents get jobs in a factory and live out their lives undetected in a back-street
it was all nonsense as they both knew
in reality there was no escape
even the one plan that was practicable suicide they had no intention of carrying out
to hang on from day to day and from week to week spinning out a present that had no future seemed an unconquerable instinct just as one 's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available
sometimes too they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the party but with no notion of how to take the first step
even if the fabulous brotherhood was a reality there still remained the difficulty of finding one 's way into it
he told her of the strange intimacy that existed or seemed to exist between himself and o'brien and of the impulse he sometimes felt simply to walk into o'brien 's presence announce that he was the enemy of the party and demand his help
curiously enough this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do
she was used to judging people by their faces and it seemed natural to her that winston should believe o'brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes
moreover she took it for granted that everyone or nearly everyone secretly hated the party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so
but she refused to believe that widespread organized opposition existed or could exist
the tales about goldstein and his underground army she said were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in
times beyond number at party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief
when public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the youth league who surrounded the courts from morning to night chanting at intervals death to the traitors !
during the two minutes hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at goldstein
yet she had only the dimmest idea of who goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent
she had grown up since the revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties
such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination : and in any case the party was invincible
it would always exist and it would always be the same
you could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or at most by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up
in some ways she was far more acute than winston and far less susceptible to party propaganda
once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against eurasia she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening
the rocket bombs which fell daily on london were probably fired by the government of oceania itself just to keep people frightened
this was an idea that had literally never occurred to him
she also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the two minutes hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing
but she only questioned the teachings of the party when they in some way touched upon her own life
often she was ready to accept the official mythology simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her
she believed for instance having learnt it at school that the party had invented aeroplanes
 ( in his own schooldays winston remembered in the late fifties it was only the helicopter that the party claimed to have invented ; a dozen years later when julia was at school it was already claiming the aeroplane ; one generation more and it would be claiming the steam engine ) 
and when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the revolution the fact struck her as totally uninteresting
after all what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes ?
it was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that oceania four years ago had been at war with eastasia and at peace with eurasia
it was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham : but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed
i thought we 'd always been at war with eurasia she said vaguely
it frightened him a little
the invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth but the switchover in the war had happened only four years ago well after she was grown up
he argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour
in the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time eastasia and not eurasia had been the enemy
but the issue still struck her as unimportant
who cares ?
she said impatiently
it 's always one bloody war after another and one knows the news is all lies anyway
sometimes he talked to her of the records department and the impudent forgeries that he committed there
such things did not appear to horrify her
she did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths
he told her the story of jones aaronson and rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers
it did not make much impression on her
at first indeed she failed to grasp the point of the story
were they friends of yours ?
she said
no i never knew them
they were inner party members
besides they were far older men than i was
they belonged to the old days before the revolution
i barely knew them by sight
then what was there to worry about ?
people are being killed off all the time aren't they ?
he tried to make her understand
this was an exceptional case
it wasn't just a question of somebody being killed
do you realize that the past starting from yesterday has been actually abolished ?
if it survives anywhere it 's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them like that lump of glass there
already we know almost literally nothing about the revolution and the years before the revolution
every record has been destroyed or falsified every book has been rewritten every picture has been repainted every statue and street and building has been renamed every date has been altered
and that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute
history has stopped
nothing exists except an endless present in which the party is always right
i know of course that the past is falsified but it would never be possible for me to prove it even when i did the falsification myself
after the thing is done no evidence ever remains
the only evidence is inside my own mind and i don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories
just in that one instance in my whole life i did possess actual concrete evidence after the event - years after it
and what good was that ?
it was no good because i threw it away a few minutes later
but if the same thing happened today i should keep it
well i wouldn't ! said julia
i 'm quite ready to take risks but only for something worth while not for bits of old newspaper
what could you have done with it even if you had kept it ?
not much perhaps
but it was evidence
it might have planted a few doubts here and there supposing that i 'd dared to show it to anybody
i don't imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime
but one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there - small groups of people banding themselves together and gradually growing and even leaving a few records behind so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off
i 'm not interested in the next generation dear
i 'm interested in us
you 're only a rebel from the waist downwards he told her
she thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight
in the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest
whenever he began to talk of the principles of ingsoc doublethink the mutability of the past and the denial of objective reality and to use newspeak words she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing
one knew that it was all rubbish so why let oneself be worried by it ?
she knew when to cheer and when to boo and that was all one needed
if he persisted in talking of such subjects she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep
she was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position
talking to her he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant
in a way the world-view of the party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it
they could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening
by lack of understanding they remained sane
they simply swallowed everything and what they swallowed did them no harm because it left no residue behind just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird
it had happened at last
the expected message had come
all his life it seemed to him he had been waiting for this to happen
he was walking down the long corridor at the ministry and he was almost at the spot where julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him
the person whoever it was gave a small cough evidently as a prelude to speaking
winston stopped abruptly and turned
it was o'brien
at last they were face to face and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away
his heart bounded violently
he would have been incapable of speaking
o'brien however had continued forward in the same movement laying a friendly hand for a moment on winston 's arm so that the two of them were walking side by side
he began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of inner party members
i had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you he said
i was reading one of your newspeak articles in the times the other day
you take a scholarly interest in newspeak i believe ?
winston had recovered part of his self-possession
hardly scholarly he said
i 'm only an amateur
it 's not my subject
i have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language
but you write it very elegantly said o'brien
that is not only my own opinion
i was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert
his name has slipped my memory for the moment
again winston 's heart stirred painfully
it was inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference to syme
but syme was not only dead he was abolished an unperson
any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous
o'brien 's remark must obviously have been intended as a signal a codeword
by sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices
they had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor but now o'brien halted
with the curious disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose
then he went on :
what i had really intended to say was that in your article i noticed you had used two words which have become obsolete
but they have only become so very recently
have you seen the tenth edition of the newspeak dictionary ?
no said winston
i didn't think it had been issued yet
we are still using the ninth in the records department
the tenth edition is not due to appear for some months i believe
but a few advance copies have been circulated
i have one myself
it might interest you to look at it perhaps ?
very much so said winston immediately seeing where this tended
some of the new developments are most ingenious
the reduction in the number of verbs - that is the point that will appeal to you i think
let me see shall i send a messenger to you with the dictionary ?
but i am afraid i invariably forget anything of that kind
perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you ?
wait
let me give you my address
they were standing in front of a telescreen
somewhat absentmindedly o'brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered notebook and a gold ink-pencil
immediately beneath the telescreen in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing he scribbled an address tore out the page and handed it to winston
i am usually at home in the evenings he said
if not my servant will give you the dictionary
he was gone leaving winston holding the scrap of paper which this time there was no need to conceal
nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers
they had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most
there was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have
it had been contrived as a way of letting winston know o'brien 's address
this was necessary because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to discover where anyone lived
there were no directories of any kind
if you ever want to see me this is where i can be found was what o'brien had been saying to him
perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary
but at any rate one thing was certain
the conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist and he had reached the outer edges of it
he knew that sooner or later he would obey o'brien 's summons
perhaps tomorrow perhaps after a long delay - he was not certain
what was happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago
the first step had been a secret involuntary thought the second had been the opening of the diary
he had moved from thoughts to words and now from words to actions
the last step was something that would happen in the ministry of love
he had accepted it
the end was contained in the beginning
but it was frightening : or more exactly it was like a foretaste of death like being a little less alive
even while he was speaking to o'brien when the meaning of the words had sunk in a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body
he had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him
winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears
julia rolled sleepily against him murmuring something that might have been what 's the matter ?
i dreamt - he began and stopped short
it was too complex to be put into words
there was the dream itself and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking
he lay back with his eyes shut still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream
it was a vast luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain
it had all occurred inside the glass paperweight but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances
the dream had also been comprehended by - indeed in some sense it had consisted in - a gesture of the arm made by his mother and made again thirty years later by the jewish woman he had seen on the news film trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets before the helicopter blew them both to pieces
do you know he said that until this moment i believed i had murdered my mother ?
why did you murder her ?
said julia almost asleep
i didn't murder her
not physically
in the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother and within a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all come back
it was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his consciousness over many years
he was not certain of the date but he could not have been less than ten years old possibly twelve when it had happened
his father had disappeared some time earlier how much earlier he could not remember
he remembered better the rackety uneasy circumstances of the time : the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in tube stations the piles of rubble everywhere the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour the enormous queues outside the bakeries the intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance - above all the fact that there was never enough to eat
he remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves potato peelings sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders ; and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed and which when they jolted over the bad patches in the road sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake
when his father disappeared his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief but a sudden change came over her
she seemed to have become completely spiritless
it was evident even to winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen
she did everything that was needed - cooked washed mended made the bed swept the floor dusted the mantelpiece - always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion like an artist 's lay-figure moving of its own accord
her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness
for hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed nursing his young sister a tiny ailing very silent child of two or three with a face made simian by thinness
very occasionally she would take winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything
he was aware in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness that this was somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen
he remembered the room where they lived a dark closesmelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane
there was a gas ring in the fender and a shelf where food was kept and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink common to several rooms
he remembered his mother 's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan
above all he remembered his continuous hunger and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes
he would ask his mother naggingly over and over again why there was not more food he would shout and storm at her ( he even remembered the tones of his voice which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way ) or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share
his mother was quite ready to give him more than his share
she took it for granted that he the boy should have the biggest portion ; but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more
at every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food but it was no use
he would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands he would grab bits from his sister 's plate
he knew that he was starving the other two but he could not help it ; he even felt that he had a right to do it
the clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him
between meals if his mother did not stand guard he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf
one day a chocolate-ration was issued
there had been no such issue for weeks or months past
he remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate
it was a two-ounce slab ( they still talked about ounces in those days ) between the three of them
it was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts
suddenly as though he were listening to somebody else winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece
his mother told him not to be greedy
there was a long nagging argument that went round and round with shouts whines tears remonstrances bargainings
his tiny sister clinging to her mother with both hands exactly like a baby monkey sat looking over her shoulder at him with large mournful eyes
in the end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to winston giving the other quarter to his sister
the little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully perhaps not knowing what it was
winston stood watching her for a moment
then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister 's hand and was fleeing for the door
winston winston ! his mother called after him
come back !
give your sister back her chocolate !
he stopped but did not come back
his mother 's anxious eyes were fixed on his face
even now he was thinking about the thing he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening
his sister conscious of having been robbed of something had set up a feeble wail
his mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast
something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying
he turned and fled down the stairs with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand
he never saw his mother again
after he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours until hunger drove him home
when he came back his mother had disappeared
this was already becoming normal at that time
nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister
they had not taken any clothes not even his mother 's overcoat
to this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead
it was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp
as for his sister she might have been removed like winston himself to one of the colonies for homeless children ( reclamation centres they were called ) which had grown up as a result of the civil war or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother or simply left somewhere or other to die
the dream was still vivid in his mind especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained
his mind went back to another dream of two months ago
exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy whitequilted bed with the child clinging to her so she had sat in the sunken ship far underneath him and drowning deeper every minute but still looking up at him through the darkening water
he told julia the story of his mother 's disappearance
without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position
i expect you were a beastly little swine in those days she said indistinctly
all children are swine
yes
but the real point of the story -
from her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again
he would have liked to continue talking about his mother
he did not suppose from what he could remember of her that she had been an unusual woman still less an intelligent one ; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility a kind of purity simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones
her feelings were her own and could not be altered from outside
it would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless
if you loved someone you loved him and when you had nothing else to give you still gave him love
when the last of the chocolate was gone his mother had clasped the child in her arms
it was no use it changed nothing it did not produce more chocolate it did not avert the child 's death or her own ; but it seemed natural to her to do it
the refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper
the terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses mere feelings were of no account while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world
when once you were in the grip of the party what you felt or did not feel what you did or refrained from doing made literally no difference
whatever happened you vanished and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again
you were lifted clean out of the stream of history
and yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed all-important because they were not attempting to alter history
they were governed by private loyalties which they did not question
what mattered were individual relationships and a completely helpless gesture an embrace a tear a word spoken to a dying man could have value in itself
the proles it suddenly occurred to him had remained in this condition
they were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea they were loyal to one another
for the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world
the proles had stayed human
they had not become hardened inside
they had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort
and in thinking this he remembered without apparent relevance how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk
the proles are human beings he said aloud
we are not human
why not ?
said julia who had woken up again
he thought for a little while
has it ever occurred to you he said that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before it 's too late and never see each other again ?
yes dear it has occurred to me several times
but i 'm not going to do it all the same
we 've been lucky he said but it can't last much longer
you 're young
you look normal and innocent
if you keep clear of people like me you might stay alive for another fifty years
no
i 've thought it all out
what you do i 'm going to do
and don't be too downhearted
i 'm rather good at staying alive
we may be together for another six months - a year - there 's no knowing
at the end we 're certain to be apart
do you realize how utterly alone we shall be ?
when once they get hold of us there will be nothing literally nothing that either of us can do for the other
if i confess they 'll shoot you and if i refuse to confess they 'll shoot you just the same
nothing that i can do or say or stop myself from saying will put off your death for as much as five minutes
neither of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead
we shall be utterly without power of any kind
the one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray one another although even that can't make the slightest difference
if you mean confessing she said we shall do that right enough
everybody always confesses
you can't help it
they torture you
i don't mean confessing
confession is not betrayal
what you say or do doesn't matter : only feelings matter
if they could make me stop loving you - that would be the real betrayal
she thought it over
they can't do that she said finally
it 's the one thing they can't do
they can make you say anything - anything - but they can't make you believe it
they can't get inside you
no he said a little more hopefully no ; that 's quite true
they can't get inside you
if you can feel that staying human is worth while even when it can't have any result whatever you 've beaten them
he thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear
they could spy upon you night and day but if you kept your head you could still outwit them
with all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking
perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands
one did not know what happened inside the ministry of love but it was possible to guess : tortures drugs delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning
facts at any rate could not be kept hidden
they could be tracked down by enquiry they could be squeezed out of you by torture
but if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human what difference did it ultimately make ?
they could not alter your feelings : for that matter you could not alter them yourself even if you wanted to
they could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought ; but the inner heart whose workings were mysterious even to yourself remained impregnable
they had done it they had done it at last !
the room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit
the telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur ; the richness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet
at the far end of the room o'brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp with a mass of papers on either side of him
he had not bothered to look up when the servant showed julia and winston in
winston 's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak
they had done it they had done it at last was all he could think
it had been a rash act to come here at all and sheer folly to arrive together ; though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on o'brien 's doorstep
but merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve
it was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-places of the inner party or even penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived
the whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats the richness and spaciousness of everything the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down the white-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro - everything was intimidating
although he had a good pretext for coming here he was haunted at every step by the fear that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner demand his papers and order him to get out
o'brien 's servant however had admitted the two of them without demur
he was a small dark-haired man in a white jacket with a diamond-shaped completely expressionless face which might have been that of a chinese
the passage down which he led them was softly carpeted with cream-papered walls and white wainscoting all exquisitely clean
that too was intimidating
winston could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies
o'brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying it intently
his heavy face bent down so that one could see the line of the nose looked both formidable and intelligent
for perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring
then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the ministries :
items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end message
he rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the soundless carpet
a little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the newspeak words but his expression was grimmer than usual as though he were not pleased at being disturbed
the terror that winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment
it seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake
for what evidence had he in reality that o'brien was any kind of political conspirator ?
nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark : beyond that only his own secret imaginings founded on a dream
he could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary because in that case julia 's presence was impossible to explain
as o'brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him
he stopped turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall
there was a sharp snap
the voice had stopped
julia uttered a tiny sound a sort of squeak of surprise
even in the midst of his panic winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue
you can turn it off ! he said
yes said o'brien we can turn it off
we have that privilege
he was opposite them now
his solid form towered over the pair of them and the expression on his face was still indecipherable
he was waiting somewhat sternly for winston to speak but about what ?
even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted
nobody spoke
after the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent
the seconds marched past enormous
with difficulty winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on o'brien 's
then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile
with his characteristic gesture o'brien resettled his spectacles on his nose
shall i say it or will you ?
he said
i will say it said winston promptly
that thing is really turned off ?
yes everything is turned off
we are alone
we have come here because -
he paused realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives
since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from o'brien it was not easy to say why he had come here
he went on conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious :
we believe that there is some kind of conspiracy some kind of secret organization working against the party and that you are involved in it
we want to join it and work for it
we are enemies of the party
we disbelieve in the principles of ingsoc
we are thought-criminals
we are also adulterers
i tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy
if you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way we are ready
he stopped and glanced over his shoulder with the feeling that the door had opened
sure enough the little yellow-faced servant had come in without knocking
winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses
martin is one of us said o'brien impassively
bring the drinks over here martin
put them on the round table
have we enough chairs ?
then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort
bring a chair for yourself martin
this is business
you can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes
the little man sat down quite at his ease and yet still with a servant-like air the air of a valet enjoying a privilege
winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye
it struck him that the man 's whole life was playing a part and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment
o'brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid
it aroused in winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding - a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass
seen from the top the stuff looked almost black but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby
it had a sour-sweet smell
he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity
it is called wine said o'brien with a faint smile
you will have read about it in books no doubt
not much of it gets to the outer party i am afraid
his face grew solemn again and he raised his glass : i think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health
to our leader : to emmanuel goldstein
winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness
wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about
like the glass paperweight or mr charrington 's half-remembered rhymes it belonged to the vanished romantic past the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts
for some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect
actually when he came to swallow it the stuff was distinctly disappointing
the truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it
he set down the empty glass
then there is such a person as goldstein ?
he said
yes there is such a person and he is alive
where i do not know
and the conspiracy - the organization ?
is it real ?
it is not simply an invention of the thought police ?
no it is real
the brotherhood we call it
you will never learn much more about the brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it
i will come back to that presently
he looked at his wrist-watch
it is unwise even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour
you ought not to have come here together and you will have to leave separately
you comrade - he bowed his head to julia - will leave first
we have about twenty minutes at our disposal
you will understand that i must start by asking you certain questions
in general terms what are you prepared to do ?
anything that we are capable of said winston
o'brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing winston
he almost ignored julia seeming to take it for granted that winston could speak for her
for a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes
he began asking his questions in a low expressionless voice as though this were a routine a sort of catechism most of whose answers were known to him already
you are prepared to give your lives ?
yes
you are prepared to commit murder ?
yes
to commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people ?
yes
to betray your country to foreign powers ?
yes
you are prepared to cheat to forge to blackmail to corrupt the minds of children to distribute habit-forming drugs to encourage prostitution to disseminate venereal diseases - to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the party ?
yes
if for example it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child 's face - are you prepared to do that ?
yes
you are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dock-worker ?
yes
you are prepared to commit suicide if and when we order you to do so ?
yes
you are prepared the two of you to separate and never see one another again ?
no ! broke in julia
it appeared to winston that a long time passed before he answered
for a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech
his tongue worked soundlessly forming the opening syllables first of one word then of the other over and over again
until he had said it he did not know which word he was going to say
no he said finally
you did well to tell me said o'brien
it is necessary for us to know everything
he turned himself toward julia and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it :
do you understand that even if he survives it may be as a different person ?
we may be obliged to give him a new identity
his face his movements the shape of his hands the colour of his hair - even his voice would be different
and you yourself might have become a different person
our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition
sometimes it is necessary
sometimes we even amputate a limb
winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at martin 's mongolian face
there were no scars that he could see
julia had turned a shade paler so that her freckles were showing but she faced o'brien boldly
she murmured something that seemed to be assent
good
then that is settled
there was a silver box of cigarettes on the table
with a rather absent-minded air o'brien pushed them towards the others took one himself then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro as though he could think better standing
they were very good cigarettes very thick and well-packed with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper
o'brien looked at his wrist-watch again
you had better go back to your pantry martin he said
i shall switch on in a quarter of an hour
take a good look at these comrades faces before you go
you will be seeing them again
i may not
exactly as they had done at the front door the little man 's dark eyes flickered over their faces
there was not a trace of friendliness in his manner
he was memorizing their appearance but he felt no interest in them or appeared to feel none
it occurred to winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression
without speaking or giving any kind of salutation martin went out closing the door silently behind him
o'brien was strolling up and down one hand in the pocket of his black overalls the other holding his cigarette
you understand he said that you will be fighting in the dark
you will always be in the dark
you will receive orders and you will obey them without knowing why
later i shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in and the strategy by which we shall destroy it
when you have read the book you will be full members of the brotherhood
but between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment you will never know anything
i tell you that the brotherhood exists but i cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members or ten million
from your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen
you will have three or four contacts who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear
as this was your first contact it will be preserved
when you receive orders they will come from me
if we find it necessary to communicate with you it will be through martin
when you are finally caught you will confess
that is unavoidable
but you will have very little to confess other than your own actions
you will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people
probably you will not even betray me
by that time i may be dead or i shall have become a different person with a different face
he continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet
in spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements
it came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket or manipulated a cigarette
more even than of strength he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony
however much in earnest he might be he had nothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic
when he spoke of murder suicide venereal disease amputated limbs and altered faces it was with a faint air of persiflage
this is unavoidable his voice seemed to say ; this is what we have got to do unflinchingly
but this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again
a wave of admiration almost of worship flowed out from winston towards o'brien
for the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of goldstein
when you looked at o'brien 's powerful shoulders and his blunt-featured face so ugly and yet so civilized it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated
there was no stratagem that he was not equal to no danger that he could not foresee
even julia seemed to be impressed
she had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently
o'brien went on :
you will have heard rumours of the existence of the brotherhood
no doubt you have formed your own picture of it
you have imagined probably a huge underworld of conspirators meeting secretly in cellars scribbling messages on walls recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand
nothing of the kind exists
the members of the brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others
goldstein himself if he fell into the hands of the thought police could not give them a complete list of members or any information that would lead them to a complete list
no such list exists
the brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense
nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible
you will never have anything to sustain you except the idea
you will get no comradeship and no encouragement
when finally you are caught you will get no help
we never help our members
at most when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner 's cell
you will have to get used to living without results and without hope
you will work for a while you will be caught you will confess and then you will die
those are the only results that you will ever see
there is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime
we are the dead
our only true life is in the future
we shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone
but how far away that future may be there is no knowing
it might be a thousand years
at present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little
we cannot act collectively
we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual generation after generation
in the face of the thought police there is no other way
he halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch
it is almost time for you to leave comrade he said to julia
wait
the decanter is still half full
he filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem
what shall it be this time ?
he said still with the same faint suggestion of irony
to the confusion of the thought police ?
to the death of big brother ?
to humanity ?
to the future ?
to the past said winston
the past is more important agreed o'brien gravely
they emptied their glasses and a moment later julia stood up to go
o'brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue
it was important he said not to go out smelling of wine : the lift attendants were very observant
as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence
he took another pace or two up and down then stopped
there are details to be settled he said
i assume that you have a hiding-place of some kind ?
winston explained about the room over mr charrington 's shop
that will do for the moment
later we will arrange something else for you
it is important to change one 's hiding-place frequently
meanwhile i shall send you a copy of the book - even o'brien winston noticed seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italics - goldstein 's book you understand as soon as possible
it may be some days before i can get hold of one
there are not many in existence as you can imagine
the thought police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them
it makes very little difference
the book is indestructible
if the last copy were gone we could reproduce it almost word for word
do you carry a brief-case to work with you ?
he added
as a rule yes
what is it like ?
black very shabby
with two straps
black two straps very shabby - good
one day in the fairly near future - i cannot give a date - one of the messages among your morning 's work will contain a misprinted word and you will have to ask for a repeat
on the following day you will go to work without your brief-case
at some time during the day in the street a man will touch you on the arm and say i think you have dropped your brief-case
the one he gives you will contain a copy of goldstein 's book
you will return it within fourteen days
they were silent for a moment
there are a couple of minutes before you need go said o'brien
we shall meet again - if we do meet again -
winston looked up at him
in the place where there is no darkness ?
he said hesitantly
o'brien nodded without appearance of surprise
in the place where there is no darkness he said as though he had recognized the allusion
and in the meantime is there anything that you wish to say before you leave ?
any message ?
any question ?
winston thought
there did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask : still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding generalities
instead of anything directly connected with o'brien or the brotherhood there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days and the little room over mr charrington 's shop and the glass paperweight and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame
almost at random he said :
did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement 's ?
again o'brien nodded
with a sort of grave courtesy he completed the stanza :
oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement 's
you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martin 's
when will you pay me ? say the bells of old bailey
when i grow rich say the bells of shoreditch
you knew the last line ! said winston
yes i knew the last line
and now i am afraid it is time for you to go
but wait
you had better let me give you one of these tablets
as winston stood up o'brien held out a hand
his powerful grip crushed the bones of winston 's palm
at the door winston looked back but o'brien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind
he was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen
beyond him winston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers
the incident was closed
within thirty seconds it occurred to him o'brien would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the party
winston was gelatinous with fatigue
gelatinous was the right word
it had come into his head spontaneously
his body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly but its translucency
he felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it
all the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work leaving only a frail structure of nerves bones and skin
all sensations seemed to be magnified
his overalls fretted his shoulders the pavement tickled his feet even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak
he had worked more than ninety hours in five days
so had everyone else in the ministry
now it was all over and he had literally nothing to do no party work of any description until tomorrow morning
he could spend six hours in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed
slowly in mild afternoon sunshine he walked up a dingy street in the direction of mr charrington 's shop keeping one eye open for the patrols but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him
the heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg
inside it was the book which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened nor even looked at
on the sixth day of hate week after the processions the speeches the shouting the singing the banners the posters the films the waxworks the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets the tramp of marching feet the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks the roar of massed planes the booming of guns - after six days of this when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the 2 000 eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces - at just this moment it had been announced that oceania was not after all at war with eurasia
oceania was at war with eastasia
eurasia was an ally
there was of course no admission that any change had taken place
merely it became known with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once that eastasia and not eurasia was the enemy
winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central london squares at the moment when it happened
it was night and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit
the square was packed with several thousand people including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the spies
on a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the inner party a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled was haranguing the crowd
a little rumpelstiltskin figure contorted with hatred he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other enormous at the end of a bony arm clawed the air menacingly above his head
his voice made metallic by the amplifiers boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities massacres deportations lootings rapings torture of prisoners bombing of civilians lying propaganda unjust aggressions broken treaties
it was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened
at every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats
the most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren
the speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker 's hand
he unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech
nothing altered in his voice or manner or in the content of what he was saying but suddenly the names were different
without words said a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd
oceania was at war with eastasia !
the next moment there was a tremendous commotion
the banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong !
quite half of them had the wrong faces on them
it was sabotage !
the agents of goldstein had been at work !
there was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot
the spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys
but within two or three minutes it was all over
the orator still gripping the neck of the microphone his shoulders hunched forward his free hand clawing at the air had gone straight on with his speech
one minute more and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd
the hate continued exactly as before except that the target had been changed
the thing that impressed winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence not only without a pause but without even breaking the syntax
but at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him
it was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said excuse me i think you 've dropped your brief-case
he took the brief-case abstractedly without speaking
he knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it
the instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the ministry of truth though the time was now nearly twenty-three hours
the entire staff of the ministry had done likewise
the orders already issuing from the telescreen recalling them to their posts were hardly necessary
oceania was at war with eastasia : oceania had always been at war with eastasia
a large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete
reports and records of all kinds newspapers books pamphlets films sound-tracks photographs - all had to be rectified at lightning speed
although no directive was ever issued it was known that the chiefs of the department intended that within one week no reference to the war with eurasia or the alliance with eastasia should remain in existence anywhere
the work was overwhelming all the more so because the processes that it involved could not be called by their true names
everyone in the records department worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four with two three-hour snatches of sleep
mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors : meals consisted of sandwiches and victory coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen
each time that winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work and each time that he crawled back sticky-eyed and aching it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work
what was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical
often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination
even the geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable
by the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes
it was like struggling with some crushing physical task something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish
in so far as he had time to remember it he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite every stroke of his ink-pencil was a deliberate lie
he was as anxious as anyone else in the department that the forgery should be perfect
on the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down
for as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube ; then one more cylinder then nothing
everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off
a deep and as it were secret sigh went through the department
a mighty deed which could never be mentioned had been achieved
it was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with eurasia had ever happened
at twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the ministry were free till tomorrow morning
winston still carrying the brief-case containing the book which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his body while he slept went home shaved himself and almost fell asleep in his bath although the water was barely more than tepid
with a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above mr charrington 's shop
he was tired but not sleepy any longer
he opened the window lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee
julia would arrive presently : meanwhile there was the book
he sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case
a heavy black volume amateurishly bound with no name or title on the cover
the print also looked slightly irregular
the pages were worn at the edges and fell apart easily as though the book had passed through many hands
the inscription on the title-page ran :
the theory and practic of oligarchical collectivism by emmanuel goldstein
winston began reading :
ignorance is strength
throughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middle and the low
they have been subdivided in many ways they have borne countless different names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude towards one another have varied from age to age : but the essential structure of society has never altered
even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it is pushed one way or the other
winston stopped reading chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading in comfort and safety
he was alone : no telescreen no ear at the keyhole no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand
the sweet summer air played against his cheek
from somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children : in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock
he settled deeper into the arm-chair and put his feet up on the fender
it was bliss it was eternity
suddenly as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word he opened it at a different place and found himself at chapter iii
he went on reading :
chapter iii
war is peace
the splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century
with the absorption of europe by russia and of the british empire by the united states two of the three existing powers eurasia and oceania were already effectively in being
the third eastasia only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting
the frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war but in general they follow geographical lines
eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the european and asiatic land-mass from portugal to the bering strait
oceania comprises the americas the atlantic islands including the british isles australasia and the southern portion of africa
eastasia smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier comprises china and the countries to the south of it the japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of manchuria mongolia and tibet
in one combination or another these three super-states are permanently at war and have been so for the past twenty-five years
war however is no longer the desperate annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth centary
it is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference
this is not to say that either the conduct of war or the prevailing attitude towards it has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous
on the contrary war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries and such acts as raping looting the slaughter of children the reduction of whole populations to slavery and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive are looked upon as normal and when they are committed by one 's own side and not by the enemy meritorious
but in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people mostly highly-trained specialists and causes comparatively few casualties
the fighting when there is any takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at or round the floating fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes
in the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths
war has in fact changed its character
more exactly the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of importance
motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon
to understand the nature of the present war - for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years it is always the same war - one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive
none of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination
they are too evenly matched and their natural defences are too formidable
eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces
oceania by the width of the atlantic and the pacific eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants
secondly there is no longer in a material sense anything to fight about
with the establishment of self-contained economies in which production and consumption are geared to one another the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death
in any case each of the three super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries
in so far as the war has a direct economic purpose it is a war for labour power
between the frontiers of the super-states and not permanently in the possession of any of them there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at tangier brazzaville darwin and hong kong containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth
it is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions and of the northern ice-cap that the three powers are constantly struggling
in practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area
portions of it are constantly changing hands and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment
all of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals and some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods
but above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour
whichever power controls equatorial africa or the countries of the middle east or southern india or the indonesian archipelago disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies
the inhabitants of these areas reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves pass continually from conqueror to conqueror and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments to capture more territory to control more labour power to turn out more armaments to capture more territory and so on indefinitely
it should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas
the frontiers of eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the congo and the northern shore of the mediterranean ; the islands of the indian ocean and the pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by oceania or by eastasia ; in mongolia the dividing line between eurasia and eastasia is never stable ; round the pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored : but the balance of power always remains roughly even and the territory which forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate
moreover the labour of the exploited peoples round the equator is not really necessary to the world 's economy
they add nothing to the wealth of the world since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war
by their labour the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up
but if they did not exist the structure of world society and the process by which it maintains itself would not be essentially different
the primary aim of modern warfare ( in accordance with the principles of doublethink this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the inner party ) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living
ever since the end of the nineteenth century the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society
at present when few human beings even have enough to eat this problem is obviously not urgent and it might not have become so even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work
the world of today is a bare hungry dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914 and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward
in the early twentieth century the vision of a future society unbelievably rich leisured orderly and efficient - a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete - was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person
science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing
this failed to happen partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought which could not survive in a strictly regimented society
as a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago
certain backward areas have advanced and various devices always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage have been developed but experiment and invention have largely stopped and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been fully repaired
nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there
from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery and therefore to a great extent for human inequality had disappeared
if the machine were used deliberately for that end hunger overwork dirt illiteracy and disease could be eliminated within a few generations
and in fact without being used for any such purpose but by a sort of automatic process - by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute - the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries
but it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction - indeed in some sense was the destruction - of a hierarchical society
in a world in which everyone worked short hours had enough to eat lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared
if it once became general wealth would confer no distinction
it was possible no doubt to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste
but in practice such a society could not long remain stable
for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves ; and when once they had done this they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function and they would sweep it away
in the long run a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance
to return to the agricultural past as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing was not a practicable solution
it conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world and moreover any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated directly or indirectly by its more advanced rivals
nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods
this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism roughly between 1920 and 1940
the economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate land went out of cultivation capital equipment was not added to great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by state charity
but this too entailed military weakness and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary it made opposition inevitable
the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world
goods must be produced but they must not be distributed
and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare
the essential act of war is destruction not necessarily of human lives but of the products of human labour
war is a way of shattering to pieces or pouring into the stratosphere or sinking in the depths of the sea materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and hence in the long run too intelligent
even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed
a floating fortress for example has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships
ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete never having brought any material benefit to anybody and with further enormous labours another floating fortress is built
in principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population
in practice the needs of the population are always underestimated with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life ; but this is looked on as an advantage
it is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another
by the standards of the early twentieth century even a member of the inner party lives an austere laborious kind of life
nevertheless the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large well-appointed flat the better texture of his clothes the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco his two or three servants his private motor-car or helicopter - set him in a different world from a member of the outer party and the members of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call the proles
the social atmosphere is that of a besieged city where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty
and at the same time the consciousness of being at war and therefore in danger makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural unavoidable condition of survival
war it will be seen accomplishes the necessary destruction but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way
in principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids by digging holes and filling them up again or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them
but this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society
what is concerned here is not the morale of masses whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work but the morale of the party itself
even the humblest party member is expected to be competent industrious and even intelligent within narrow limits but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear hatred adulation and orgiastic triumph
in other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war
it does not matter whether the war is actually happening and since no decisive victory is possible it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly
all that is needed is that a state of war should exist
the splitting of the intelligence which the party requires of its members and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war is now almost universal but the higher up the ranks one goes the more marked it becomes
it is precisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest
in his capacity as an administrator it is often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones : but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink
meanwhile no inner party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real and that it is bound to end victoriously with oceania the undisputed master of the entire world
all members of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith
it is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon
the search for new weapons continues unceasingly and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet
in oceania at the present day science in the old sense has almost ceased to exist
in newspeak there is no word for science
the empirical method of thought on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded is opposed to the most fundamental principles of ingsoc
and even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty
in all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards
the fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery
but in matters of vital importance - meaning in effect war and police espionage - the empirical approach is still encouraged or at least tolerated
the two aims of the party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought
there are therefore two great problems which the party is concerned to solve
one is how to discover against his will what another human being is thinking and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand
in so far as scientific research still continues this is its subject matter
the scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions gestures and tones of voice and testing the truth-producing effects of drugs shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture ; or he is chemist physicist or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life
in the vast laboratories of the ministry of peace and in the experimental stations hidden in the brazilian forests or in the australian desert or on lost islands of the antarctic the teams of experts are indefatigably at work
some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars ; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs more and more powerful explosives and more and more impenetrable armour-plating ; others search for new and deadlier gases or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies ; others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship ; others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun 's rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth 's centre
but none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization and none of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others
what is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess in the atomic bomb a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover
although the party according to its habit claims the invention for itself atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties and were first used on a large scale about ten years later
at that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres chiefly in european russia western europe and north america
the effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society and hence of their own power
thereafter although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at no more bombs were dropped
all three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later
and meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years
helicopters are more used than they were formerly bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress ; but otherwise there has been little development
the tank the submarine the torpedo the machine gun even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use
and in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreens the desperate battles of earlier wars in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks have never been repeated
none of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat
when any large operation is undertaken it is usually a surprise attack against an ally
the strategy that all three powers are following or pretend to themselves that they are following is the same
the plan is by a combination of fighting bargaining and well-timed strokes of treachery to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep
during this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots ; finally they will all be fired simultaneously with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible
it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power in preparation for another attack
this scheme it is hardly necessary to say is a mere daydream impossible of realization
moreover no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the equator and the pole : no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken
this explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary
eurasia for example could easily conquer the british isles which are geographically part of europe or on the other hand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rhine or even to the vistula
but this would violate the principle followed on all sides though never formulated of cultural integrity
if oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as france and germany it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants a task of great physical difficulty or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people who so far as technical development goes are roughly on the oceanic level
the problem is the same for all three super-states
it is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners except to a limited extent with war prisoners and coloured slaves
even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion
war prisoners apart the average citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages
if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies
the sealed world in which he lives would be broken and the fear hatred and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate
it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persia or egypt or java or ceylon may change hands the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs
under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud but tacitly understood and acted upon : namely that the conditions of life in all three super-states are very much the same
in oceania the prevailing philosophy is called ingsoc in eurasia it is called neo-bolshevism and in eastasia it is called by a chinese name usually translated as death-worship but perhaps better rendered as obliteration of the self
the citizen of oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense
actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all
everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure the same worship of semi-divine leader the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare
it follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer one another but would gain no advantage by doing so
on the contrary so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up like three sheaves of corn
and as usual the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing
their lives are dedicated to world conquest but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory
meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of ingsoc and its rival systems of thought
here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character
in past ages a war almost by definition was something that sooner or later came to an end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat
in the past also war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality
all rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency
so long as defeat meant the loss of independence or some other result generally held to be undesirable the precautions against defeat had to be serious
physical facts could not be ignored
in philosophy or religion or ethics or politics two and two might make five but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four
inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions
moreover to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past
newspapers and history books were of course always coloured and biased but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible
war was a sure safeguard of sanity and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards
while wars could be won or lost no ruling class could be completely irresponsible
but when war becomes literally continuous it also ceases to be dangerous
when war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity
technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded
as we have seen researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming and their failure to show results is not important
efficiency even military efficiency is no longer needed
nothing is efficient in oceania except the thought police
since each of the three super-states is unconquerable each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised
reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life - the need to eat and drink to get shelter and clothing to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top-storey windows and the like
between life and death and between physical pleasure and physical pain there is still a distinction but that is all
cut off from contact with the outer world and with the past the citizen of oceania is like a man in interstellar space who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down
the rulers of such a state are absolute as the pharaohs or the caesars could not be
they are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals ; but once that minimum is achieved they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose
the war therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars is merely an imposture
it is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another
but though it is unreal it is not meaningless
it eats up the surplus of consumable goods and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs
war it will be seen is now a purely internal affair
in the past the ruling groups of all countries although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war did fight against one another and the victor always plundered the vanquished
in our own day they are not fighting against one another at all
the war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory but to keep the structure of society intact
the very word war therefore has become misleading
it would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist
the peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the neolithic age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different
the effect would be much the same if the three super-states instead of fighting one another should agree to live in perpetual peace each inviolate within its own boundaries
for in that case each would still be a self-contained universe freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger
a peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war
this - although the vast majority of party members understand it only in a shallower sense - is the inner meaning of the party slogan : war is peace
winston stopped reading for a moment
somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered
the blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book in a room with no telescreen had not worn off
solitude and safety were physical sensations mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body the softness of the chair the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek
the book fascinated him or more exactly it reassured him
in a sense it told him nothing that was new but that was part of the attraction
it said what he would have said if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order
it was the product of a mind similar to his own but enormously more powerful more systematic less fear-ridden
the best books he perceived are those that tell you what you know already
he had just turned back to chapter i when he heard julia 's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her
she dumped her brown tool-bag on the floor and flung herself into his arms
it was more than a week since they had seen one another
i 've got the book he said as they disentangled themselves
oh you 've got it ?
good she said without much interest and almost immediately knelt down beside the oilstove to make the coffee
they did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour
the evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane
from below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones
the brawny red-armed woman whom winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard
there seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song
julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep
he reached out for the book which was lying on the floor and sat up against the bedhead
we must read it he said
you too
all members of the brotherhood have to read it
you read it she said with her eyes shut
read it aloud
that 's the best way
then you can explain it to me as you go
the clock 's hands said six meaning eighteen
they had three or four hours ahead of them
he propped the book against his knees and began reading :
chapter i
ignorance is strength
throughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middle and the low
they have been subdivided in many ways they have borne countless different names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude towards one another have varied from age to age : but the essential structure of society has never altered
even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it is pushed one way or the other
julia are you awake ?
said winston
yes my love i 'm listening
go on
it 's marvellous
he continued reading :
the aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable
the aim of the high is to remain where they are
the aim of the middle is to change places with the high
the aim of the low when they have an aim - for it is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives - is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal
thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again
for long periods the high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently or both
they are then overthrown by the middle who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice
as soon as they have reached their objective the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude and themselves become the high
presently a new middle group splits off from one of the other groups or from both of them and the struggle begins over again
of the three groups only the low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims
it would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind
even today in a period of decline the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago
but no advance in wealth no softening of manners no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer
from the point of view of the low no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters
by the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers
there then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life
this doctrine of course had always had its adherents but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change
in the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the high
it had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests lawyers and the like who were parasitical upon them and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave
the middle so long as it was struggling for power had always made use of such terms as freedom justice and fraternity
now however the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command but merely hoped to be so before long
in the past the middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown
the new middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand
socialism a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity was still deeply infected by the utopianism of past ages
but in each variant of socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned
the new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century ingsoc in oceania neo-bolshevism in eurasia death-worship as it is commonly called in eastasia had the conscious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality
these new movements of course grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology
but the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment
the familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more and then stop
as usual the high were to be turned out by the middle who would then become the high ; but this time by conscious strategy the high would be able to maintain their position permanently
the new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge and the growth of the historical sense which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century
the cyclical movement of history was now intelligible or appeared to be so ; and if it was intelligible then it was alterable
but the principal underlying cause was that as early as the beginning of the twentieth century human equality had become technically possible
it was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others ; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth
in earlier ages class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable
inequality was the price of civilization
with the development of machine production however the case was altered
even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels
therefore from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after but a danger to be averted
in more primitive ages when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible it had been fairly easy to believe it
the idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood without laws and without brute labour had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years
and this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change
the heirs of the french english and american revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man freedom of speech equality before the law and the like and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent
but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian
the earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable
every new political theory by whatever name it called itself led back to hierarchy and regimentation
and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930 practices which had been long abandoned in some cases for hundreds of years - imprisonment without trial the use of war prisoners as slaves public executions torture to extract confessions the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populations - not only became common again but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive
it was only after a decade of national wars civil wars revolutions and counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked-out political theories
but they had been foreshadowed by the various systems generally called totalitarian which had appeared earlier in the century and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious
what kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious
the new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats scientists technicians trade-union organizers publicity experts sociologists teachers journalists and professional politicians
these people whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government
as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages they were less avaricious less tempted by luxury hungrier for pure power and above all more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition
this last difference was cardinal
by comparison with that existing today all the tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient
the ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas and were content to leave loose ends everywhere to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking
even the catholic church of the middle ages was tolerant by modern standards
part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance
the invention of print however made it easier to manipulate public opinion and the film and the radio carried the process further
with the development of television and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument private life came to an end
every citizen or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching could be kept for twentyfour hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda with all other channels of communication closed
the possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the state but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects now existed for the first time
after the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties society regrouped itself as always into high middle and low
but the new high group unlike all its forerunners did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its position
it had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism
wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly
the so-called abolition of private property which took place in the middle years of the century meant in effect the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before : but with this difference that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals
individually no member of the party owns anything except petty personal belongings
collectively the party owns everything in oceania because it controls everything and disposes of the products as it thinks fit
in the years following the revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization
it had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated socialism must follow : and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated
factories mines land houses transport - everything had been taken away from them : and since these things were no longer private property it followed that they must be public property
ingsoc which grew out of the earlier socialist movement and inherited its phraseology has in fact carried out the main item in the socialist programme ; with the result foreseen and intended beforehand that economic inequality has been made permanent
but the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this
there are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power
either it is conquered from without or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt or it allows a strong and discontented middle group to come into being or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern
these causes do not operate singly and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree
a ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently
ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself
after the middle of the present century the first danger had in reality disappeared
each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert
the second danger also is only a theoretical one
the masses never revolt of their own accord and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed
indeed so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison they never even become aware that they are oppressed
the recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political results because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate
as for the problem of overproduction which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique it is solved by the device of continuous warfare ( see chapter iii ) which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch
from the point of view of our present rulers therefore the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able underemployed power-hungry people and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks
the problem that is to say is educational
it is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it
the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way
given this background one could infer if one did not know it already the general structure of oceanic society
at the apex of the pyramid comes big brother
big brother is infallible and all-powerful
every success every achievement every victory every scientific discovery all knowledge all wisdom all happiness all virtue are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration
nobody has ever seen big brother
he is a face on the hoardings a voice on the telescreen
we may be reasonably sure that he will never die and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born
big brother is the guise in which the party chooses to exhibit itself to the world
his function is to act as a focusing point for love fear and reverence emotions which are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization
below big brother comes the inner party its numbers limited to six millions or something less than 2 per cent of the population of oceania
below the inner party comes the outer party which if the inner party is described as the brain of the state may be justly likened to the hands
below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as the proles numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population
in the terms of our earlier classification the proles are the low : for the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure
in principle membership of these three groups is not hereditary
the child of inner party parents is in theory not born into the inner party
admission to either branch of the party is by examination taken at the age of sixteen
nor is there any racial discrimination or any marked domination of one province by another
jews negroes south americans of pure indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the party and the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area
in no part of oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital
oceania has no capital and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows
except that english is its chief lingua franca and newspeak its official language it is not centralized in any way
its rulers are not held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine
it is true that our society is stratified and very rigidly stratified on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines
there is far less to-and-fro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the pre-industrial age
between the two branches of the party there is a certain amount of interchange but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the inner party and that ambitious members of the outer party are made harmless by allowing them to rise
proletarians in practice are not allowed to graduate into the party
the most gifted among them who might possibly become nuclei of discontent are simply marked down by the thought police and eliminated
but this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent nor is it a matter of principle
the party is not a class in the old sense of the word
it does not aim at transmitting power to its own children as such ; and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat
in the crucial years the fact that the party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition
the older kind of socialist who had been trained to fight against something called class privilege assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent
he did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived whereas adoptive organizations such as the catholic church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years
the essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life imposed by the dead upon the living
a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors
the party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself
who wields power is not important provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same
all the beliefs habits tastes emotions mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from being perceived
physical rebellion or any preliminary move towards rebellion is at present not possible
from the proletarians nothing is to be feared
left to themselves they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century working breeding and dying not only without any impulse to rebel but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is
they could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly ; but since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important the level of popular education is actually declining
what opinions the masses hold or do not hold is looked on as a matter of indifference
they can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect
in a party member on the other hand not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated
a party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the thought police
even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone
wherever he may be asleep or awake working or resting in his bath or in bed he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected
nothing that he does is indifferent
his friendships his relaxations his behaviour towards his wife and children the expression of his face when he is alone the words he mutters in sleep even the characteristic movements of his body are all jealously scrutinized
not only any actual misdemeanour but any eccentricity however small any change of habits any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle is certain to be detected
he has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever
on the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour
in oceania there is no law
thoughts and actions which when detected mean certain death are not formally forbidden and the endless purges arrests tortures imprisonments and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed but are merely the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future
a party member is required to have not only the right opinions but the right instincts
many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in ingsoc
if he is a person naturally orthodox ( in newspeak a goodthinker ) he will in all circumstances know without taking thought what is the true belief or the desirable emotion
but in any case an elaborate mental training undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the newspeak words crimestop blackwhite and doublethink makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever
a party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm
he is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors triumph over victories and selfabasement before the power and wisdom of the party
the discontents produced by his bare unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the two minutes hate and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline
the first and simplest stage in the discipline which can be taught even to young children is called in newspeak crimestop
crimestop means the faculty of stopping short as though by instinct at the threshold of any dangerous thought
it includes the power of not grasping analogies of failing to perceive logical errors of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to ingsoc and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction
crimestop in short means protective stupidity
but stupidity is not enough
on the contrary orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one 's own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body
oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother is omnipotent and that the party is infallible
but since in reality big brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible there is need for an unwearying moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts
the keyword here is blackwhite
like so many newspeak words this word has two mutually contradictory meanings
applied to an opponent it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white in contradiction of the plain facts
applied to a party member it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when party discipline demands this
but it means also the ability to believe that black is white and more to know that black is white and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary
this demands a continuous alteration of the past made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest and which is known in newspeak as doublethink
the alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons one of which is subsidiary and so to speak precautionary
the subsidiary reason is that the party member like the proletarian tolerates present-day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison
he must be cut off from the past just as he must be cut off from foreign countries because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising
but by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the party
it is not merely that speeches statistics and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the party were in all cases right
it is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted
for to change one 's mind or even one 's policy is a confession of weakness
if for example eurasia or eastasia ( whichever it may be ) is the enemy today then that country must always have been the enemy
and if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered
thus history is continuously rewritten
this day-to-day falsification of the past carried out by the ministry of truth is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the ministry of love
the mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc
past events it is argued have no objective existence but survive only in written records and in human memories
the past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon
and since the party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members it follows that the past is whatever the party chooses to make it
it also follows that though the past is alterable it never has been altered in any specific instance
for when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment then this new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed
this holds good even when as often happens the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year
at all times the party is in possession of absolute truth and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now
it will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory
to make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act
but it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner
and if it is necessary to rearrange one 's memories or to tamper with written records then it is necessary to forget that one has done so
the trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique
it is learned by the majority of party members and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox
in oldspeak it is called quite frankly reality control
in newspeak it is called doublethink though doublethink comprises much else as well
doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one 's mind simultaneously and accepting both of them
the party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered ; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality ; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated
the process has to be conscious or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision but it also has to be unconscious or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt
doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsoc since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty
to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget any fact that has become inconvenient and then when it becomes necessary again to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies - all this is indispensably necessary
even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink
for by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality ; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge ; and so on indefinitely with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth
ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the party has been able - and may for all we know continue to be able for thousands of years - to arrest the course of history
all past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft
either they became stupid and arrogant failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances and were overthrown ; or they became liberal and cowardly made concessions when they should have used force and once again were overthrown
they fell that is to say either through consciousness or through unconsciousness
it is the achievement of the party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously
and upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the party be made permanent
if one is to rule and to continue ruling one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality
for the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one 's own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes
it need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating
in our society those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is
in general the greater the understanding the greater the delusion ; the more intelligent the less sane
one clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale
those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories
to these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave
which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them
they are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones
the slightly more favoured workers whom we call the proles are only intermittently conscious of the war
when it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening
it is in the ranks of the party and above all of the inner party that the true war enthusiasm is found
world-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible
this peculiar linking-together of opposites - knowledge with ignorance cynicism with fanaticism - is one of the chief distinguishing marks of oceanic society
the official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no practical reason for them
thus the party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the socialist movement originally stood and it chooses to do this in the name of socialism
it preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason
it systematically undermines the solidarity of the family and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty
even the names of the four ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts
the ministry of peace concerns itself with war the ministry of truth with lies the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation
these contradictions are not accidental nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy ; they are deliberate exercises in doublethink
for it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely
in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken
if human equality is to be for ever averted - if the high as we have called them are to keep their places permanently - then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity
but there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored
it is ; why should human equality be averted ?
supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described what is the motive for this huge accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time ?
here we reach the central secret
as we have seen the mystique of the party and above all of the inner party depends upon doublethink
but deeper than this lies the original motive the never-questioned instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink the thought police continuous warfare and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards
this motive really consists .
winston became aware of silence as one becomes aware of a new sound
it seemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past
she was lying on her side naked from the waist upwards with her cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes
her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly
julia
no answer
julia are you awake ?
no answer
she was asleep
he shut the book put it carefully on the floor lay down and pulled the coverlet over both of them
he had still he reflected not learned the ultimate secret
he understood how ; he did not understand why
chapter i like chapter iii had not actually told him anything that he did not know it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already
but after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad
being in a minority even a minority of one did not make you mad
there was truth and there was untruth and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world you were not mad
a yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow
he shut his eyes
the sun on his face and the girl 's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong sleepy confident feeling
he was safe everything was all right
he fell asleep murmuring sanity is not statistical with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom
when he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only twenty-thirty
he lay dozing for a while ; then the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard below :
the driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity
you still heard it all over the place
it had outlived the hate song
julia woke at the sound stretched herself luxuriously and got out of bed
i 'm hungry she said
let 's make some more coffee
damn !
the stove 's gone out and the water 's cold
she picked the stove up and shook it
there 's no oil in it
we can get some from old charrington i expect
the funny thing is i made sure it was full
i 'm going to put my clothes on she added
it seems to have got colder
winston also got up and dressed himself
the indefatigable voice sang on :
as he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window
the sun must have gone down behind the houses ; it was not shining into the yard any longer
the flagstones were wet as though they had just been washed and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too so fresh and pale was the blue between the chimney-pots
tirelessly the woman marched to and fro corking and uncorking herself singing and falling silent and pegging out more diapers and more and yet more
he wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren
julia had come across to his side ; together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below
as he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude her thick arms reaching up for the line her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful
it had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing then hardened roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over-ripe turnip could be beautiful
but it was so and after all he thought why not ?
the solid contourless body like a block of granite and the rasping red skin bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose
why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower ?
she 's beautiful he murmured
she 's a metre across the hips easily said julia
that is her style of beauty said winston
he held julia 's supple waist easily encircled by his arm
from the hip to the knee her flank was against his
out of their bodies no child would ever come
that was the one thing they could never do
only by word of mouth from mind to mind could they pass on the secret
the woman down there had no mind she had only strong arms a warm heart and a fertile belly
he wondered how many children she had given birth to
it might easily be fifteen
she had had her momentary flowering a year perhaps of wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse and then her life had been laundering scrubbing darning cooking sweeping polishing mending scrubbing laundering first for children then for grandchildren over thirty unbroken years
at the end of it she was still singing
the mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale cloudless sky stretching away behind the chimney-pots into interminable distance
it was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody in eurasia or eastasia as well as here
and the people under the sky were also very much the same - everywhere all over the world hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this people ignorant of one another 's existence held apart by walls of hatred and lies and yet almost exactly the same - people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world
if there was hope it lay in the proles !
without having read to the end of the book he knew that that must be goldstein 's final message
the future belonged to the proles
and could he be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be just as alien to him winston smith as the world of the party ?
yes because at the least it would be a world of sanity
where there is equality there can be sanity
sooner or later it would happen strength would change into consciousness
the proles were immortal you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard
in the end their awakening would come
and until that happened though it might be a thousand years they would stay alive against all the odds like birds passing on from body to body the vitality which the party did not share and could not kill
do you remember he said the thrush that sang to us that first day at the edge of the wood ?
he wasn't singing to us said julia
he was singing to please himself
not even that
he was just singing
the birds sang the proles sang the party did not sing
all round the world in london and new york in africa and brazil and in the mysterious forbidden lands beyond the frontiers in the streets of paris and berlin in the villages of the endless russian plain in the bazaars of china and japan - everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure made monstrous by work and childbearing toiling from birth to death and still singing
out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come
you were the dead theirs was the future
but you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four
we are the dead he said
we are the dead echoed julia dutifully
you are the dead said an iron voice behind them
they sprang apart
winston 's entrails seemed to have turned into ice
he could see the white all round the irises of julia 's eyes
her face had turned a milky yellow
the smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath
you are the dead repeated the iron voice
it was behind the picture breathed julia
it was behind the picture said the voice
remain exactly where you are
make no movement until you are ordered
it was starting it was starting at last !
they could do nothing except stand gazing into one another 's eyes
to run for life to get out of the house before it was too late - no such thought occurred to them
unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall
there was a snap as though a catch had been turned back and a crash of breaking glass
the picture had fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it
now they can see us said julia
now we can see you said the voice
stand out in the middle of the room
stand back to back
clasp your hands behind your heads
do not touch one another
they were not touching but it seemed to him that he could feel julia 's body shaking
or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own
he could just stop his teeth from chattering but his knees were beyond his control
there was a sound of trampling boots below inside the house and outside
the yard seemed to be full of men
something was being dragged across the stones
the woman 's singing had stopped abruptly
there was a long rolling clang as though the washtub had been flung across the yard and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain
the house is surrounded said winston
the house is surrounded said the voice
he heard julia snap her teeth together
i suppose we may as well say good-bye she said
you may as well say good-bye said the voice
and then another quite different voice a thin cultivated voice which winston had the impression of having heard before struck in ; and by the way while we are on the subject here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head !
something crashed on to the bed behind winston 's back
the head of a ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame
someone was climbing through the window
there was a stampede of boots up the stairs
the room was full of solid men in black uniforms with iron-shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands
winston was not trembling any longer
even his eyes he barely moved
one thing alone mattered ; to keep still to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you !
a man with a smooth prizefighter 's jowl in which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger
winston met his eyes
the feeling of nakedness with one 's hands behind one 's head and one 's face and body all exposed was almost unbearable
the man protruded the tip of a white tongue licked the place where his lips should have been and then passed on
there was another crash
someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone
the fragment of coral a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake rolled across the mat
how small thought winston how small it always was !
there was a gasp and a thump behind him and he received a violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance
one of the men had smashed his fist into julia 's solar plexus doubling her up like a pocket ruler
she was thrashing about on the floor fighting for breath
winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre but sometimes her livid gasping face came within the angle of his vision
even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath
he knew what it was like ; the terrible agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe
then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders and carried her out of the room like a sack
winston had a glimpse of her face upside down yellow and contorted with the eyes shut and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek ; and that was the last he saw of her
he stood dead still
no one had hit him yet
thoughts which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his mind
he wondered whether they had got mr charrington
he wondered what they had done to the woman in the yard
he noticed that he badly wanted to urinate and felt a faint surprise because he had done so only two or three hours ago
he noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine meaning twenty-one
but the light seemed too strong
would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an august evening ?
he wondered whether after all he and julia had mistaken the time - had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on the following morning
but he did not pursue the thought further
it was not interesting
there was another lighter step in the passage
mr charrington came into the room
the demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more subdued
something had also changed in mr charrington 's appearance
his eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight
pick up those pieces he said sharply
a man stooped to obey
the cockney accent had disappeared ; winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen
mr charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket but his hair which had been almost white had turned black
also he was not wearing his spectacles
he gave winston a single sharp glance as though verifying his identity and then paid no more attention to him
he was still recognizable but he was not the same person any longer
his body had straightened and seemed to have grown bigger
his face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation
the black eyebrows were less bushy the wrinkles were gone the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered ; even the nose seemed shorter
it was the alert cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty
it occurred to winston that for the first time in his life he was looking with knowledge at a member of the thought police
he did not know where he was
presumably he was in the ministry of love but there was no way of making certain
he was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain
concealed lamps flooded it with cold light and there was a low steady humming sound which he supposed had something to do with the air supply
a bench or shelf just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall broken only by the door and at the end opposite the door a lavatory pan with no wooden seat
there were four telescreens one in each wall
there was a dull aching in his belly
it had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away
but he was also hungry with a gnawing unwholesome kind of hunger
it might be twenty-four hours since he had eaten it might be thirty-six
he still did not know probably never would know whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him
since he was arrested he had not been fed
he sat as still as he could on the narrow bench with his hands crossed on his knee
he had already learned to sit still
if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen
but the craving for food was growing upon him
what he longed for above all was a piece of bread
he had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls
it was even possible - he thought this because from time to time something seemed to tickle his leg - that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there
in the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear ; he slipped a hand into his pocket
smith ! yelled a voice from the telescreen 6079 smith w !
hands out of pockets in the cells !
he sat still again his hands crossed on his knee
before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols
he did not know how long he had been there ; some hours at any rate ; with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge the time
it was a noisy evil-smelling place
they had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people
the majority of them were common criminals but there were a few political prisoners among them
he had sat silent against the wall jostled by dirty bodies too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour between the party prisoners and the others
the party prisoners were always silent and terrified but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody
they yelled insults at the guards fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded wrote obscene words on the floor ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hiding-places in their clothes and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore order
on the other hand some of them seemed to be on good terms with the guards called them by nicknames and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyhole in the door
the guards too treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance even when they had to handle them roughly
there was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent
it was all right in the camps he gathered so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes
there was bribery favouritism and racketeering of every kind there was homosexuality and prostitution there was even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes
the positions of trust were given only to the common criminals especially the gangsters and the murderers who formed a sort of aristocracy
all the dirty jobs were done by the politicals
there was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description : drug-peddlers thieves bandits black-marketeers drunks prostitutes
some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them
an enormous wreck of a woman aged about sixty with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles was carried in kicking and shouting by four guards who had hold of her one at each corner
they wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them and dumped her down across winston 's lap almost breaking his thigh-bones
the woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of f - bastards !
then noticing that she was sitting on something uneven she slid off winston 's knees on to the bench
beg pardon dearie she said
i wouldn't 'a sat on you only the buggers put me there
they dono 'ow to treat a lady do they ?
she paused patted her breast and belched
pardon she said i ain't meself quite
she leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor
thass better she said leaning back with closed eyes
never keep it down thass what i say
get it up while it 's fresh on your stomach like
she revived turned to have another look at winston and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him
she put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him towards her breathing beer and vomit into his face
wass your name dearie ?
she said
smith said winston
smith ?
said the woman
thass funny
my name 's smith too
why she added sentimentally i might be your mother !
she might thought winston be his mother
she was about the right age and physique and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-labour camp
no one else had spoken to him
to a surprising extent the ordinary criminals ignored the party prisoners
the polits they called them with a sort of uninterested contempt
the party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody and above all of speaking to one another
only once when two party members both women were pressed close together on the bench he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly-whispered words ; and in particular a reference to something called room one-oh-one which he did not understand
it might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here
the dull pain in his belly never went away but sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly
when it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself and of his desire for food
when it grew better panic took hold of him
there were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his breath stopped
he felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins ; he saw himself grovelling on the floor screaming for mercy through broken teeth
he hardly thought of julia
he could not fix his mind on her
he loved her and would not betray her ; but that was only a fact known as he knew the rules of arithmetic
he felt no love for her and he hardly even wondered what was happening to her
he thought oftener of o'brien with a flickering hope
o'brien might know that he had been arrested
the brotherhood he had said never tried to save its members
but there was the razor blade ; they would send the razor blade if they could
there would be perhaps five seconds before the guard could rush into the cell
the blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone
everything came back to his sick body which shrank trembling from the smallest pain
he was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got the chance
it was more natural to exist from moment to moment accepting another ten minutes ' life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it
sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell
it should have been easy but he always lost count at some point or another
more often he wondered where he was and what time of day it was
at one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness
in this place he knew instinctively the lights would never be turned out
it was the place with no darkness : he saw now why o'brien had seemed to recognize the allusion
in the ministry of love there were no windows
his cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall ; it might be ten floors below ground or thirty above it
he moved himself mentally from place to place and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground
there was a sound of marching boots outside
the steel door opened with a clang
a young officer a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather and whose pale straight-featured face was like a wax mask stepped smartly through the doorway
he motioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading
the poet ampleforth shambled into the cell
the door clanged shut again
ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of and then began to wander up and down the cell
he had not yet noticed winston 's presence
his troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the level of winston 's head
he was shoeless ; large dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks
he was also several days away from a shave
a scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones giving him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements
winston roused himself a little from his lethargy
he must speak to ampleforth and risk the yell from the telescreen
it was even conceivable that ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade
ampleforth he said
there was no yell from the telescreen
ampleforth paused mildly startled
his eyes focused themselves slowly on winston
ah smith ! he said
you too !
what are you in for ?
to tell you the truth - he sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite winston
there is only one offence is there not ?
he said
and have you committed it ?
apparently i have
he put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment as though trying to remember something
these things happen he began vaguely
i have been able to recall one instance - a possible instance
it was an indiscretion undoubtedly
we were producing a definitive edition of the poems of kipling
i allowed the word god to remain at the end of a line
i could not help it ! he added almost indignantly raising his face to look at winston
it was impossible to change the line
the rhyme was rod
do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to rod in the entire language ?
for days i had racked my brains
there was no other rhyme
the expression on his face changed
the annoyance passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased
a sort of intellectual warmth the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact shone through the dirt and scrubby hair
has it ever occurred to you he said that the whole history of english poetry has been determined by the fact that the english language lacks rhymes ?
no that particular thought had never occurred to winston
nor in the circumstances did it strike him as very important or interesting
do you know what time of day it is ?
he said
ampleforth looked startled again
i had hardly thought about it
they arrested me - it could be two days ago - perhaps three
his eyes flitted round the walls as though he half expected to find a window somewhere
there is no difference between night and day in this place
i do not see how one can calculate the time
they talked desultorily for some minutes then without apparent reason a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent
winston sat quietly his hands crossed
ampleforth too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench fidgeted from side to side clasping his lank hands first round one knee then round the other
the telescreen barked at him to keep still
time passed
twenty minutes an hour - it was difficult to judge
once more there was a sound of boots outside
winston 's entrails contracted
soon very soon perhaps in five minutes perhaps now the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come
the door opened
the cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell
with a brief movement of the hand he indicated ampleforth
room 101 he said
ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards his face vaguely perturbed but uncomprehending
what seemed like a long time passed
the pain in winston 's belly had revived
his mind sagged round and round on the same trick like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots
he had only six thoughts
the pain in his belly ; a piece of bread ; the blood and the screaming ; o'brien ; julia ; the razor blade
there was another spasm in his entrails the heavy boots were approaching
as the door opened the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat
parsons walked into the cell
he was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt
this time winston was startled into self-forgetfulness
you here ! he said
parsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor surprise but only misery
he began walking jerkily up and down evidently unable to keep still
each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that they were trembling
his eyes had a wide-open staring look as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance
what are you in for ?
said winston
thoughtcrime ! said parsons almost blubbering
the tone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be applied to himself
he paused opposite winston and began eagerly appealing to him : you don't think they 'll shoot me do you old chap ?
they don't shoot you if you haven't actually done anything - only thoughts which you can't help ?
i know they give you a fair hearing
oh i trust them for that !
they 'll know my record won't they ?
you know what kind of chap i was
not a bad chap in my way
not brainy of course but keen
i tried to do my best for the party didn't i ?
i 'll get off with five years don't you think ?
or even ten years ?
a chap like me could make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp
they wouldn't shoot me for going off the rails just once ?
are you guilty ?
said winston
of course i 'm guilty ! cried parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen
you don't think the party would arrest an innocent man do you ?
his frog-like face grew calmer and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression
thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing old man he said sententiously
it 's insidious
it can get hold of you without your even knowing it
do you know how it got hold of me ?
in my sleep !
yes that 's a fact
there i was working away trying to do my bit - never knew i had any bad stuff in my mind at all
and then i started talking in my sleep
do you know what they heard me saying ?
he sank his voice like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter an obscenity
down with big brother !
yes i said that !
said it over and over again it seems
between you and me old man i 'm glad they got me before it went any further
do you know what i 'm going to say to them when i go up before the tribunal ?
thank you i 'm going to say thank you for saving me before it was too late
who denounced you ?
said winston
it was my little daughter said parsons with a sort of doleful pride
she listened at the keyhole
heard what i was saying and nipped off to the patrols the very next day
pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh ?
i don't bear her any grudge for it
in fact i 'm proud of her
it shows i brought her up in the right spirit anyway
he made a few more jerky movements up and down several times casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan
then he suddenly ripped down his shorts
excuse me old man he said
i can't help it
it 's the waiting
he plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan
winston covered his face with his hands
smith ! yelled the voice from the telescreen 6079 smith w !
uncover your face
no faces covered in the cells
winston uncovered his face
parsons used the lavatory loudly and abundantly
it then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards
parsons was removed
more prisoners came and went mysteriously
one a woman was consigned to room 101 and winston noticed seemed to shrivel and turn a different colour when she heard the words
a time came when if it had been morning when he was brought here it would be afternoon ; or if it had been afternoon then it would be midnight
there were six prisoners in the cell men and women
all sat very still
opposite winston there sat a man with a chinless toothy face exactly like that of some large harmless rodent
his fat mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there
his pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone 's eye
the door opened and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent a momentary chill through winston
he was a commonplace mean-looking man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind
but what was startling was the emaciation of his face
it was like a skull
because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large and the eyes seemed filled with a murderous unappeasable hatred of somebody or something
the man sat down on the bench at a little distance from winston
winston did not look at him again but the tormented skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes
suddenly he realized what was the matter
the man was dying of starvation
the same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell
there was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench
the eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man then turning guiltily away then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction
presently he began to fidget on his seat
at last he stood up waddled clumsily across the cell dug down into the pocket of his overalls and with an abashed air held out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-faced man
there was a furious deafening roar from the telescreen
the chinless man jumped in his tracks
the skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands behind his back as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift
bumstead ! roared the voice 2713 bumstead j !
let fall that piece of bread !
the chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor
remain standing where you are said the voice
face the door
make no movement
the chinless man obeyed
his large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrollably
the door clanged open
as the young officer entered and stepped aside there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and shoulders
he took his stand opposite the chinless man and then at a signal from the officer let free a frightful blow with all the weight of his body behind it full in the chinless man 's mouth
the force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor
his body was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat
for a moment he lay as though stunned with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose
a very faint whimpering or squeaking which seemed unconscious came out of him
then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees
amid a stream of blood and saliva the two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth
the prisoners sat very still their hands crossed on their knees
the chinless man climbed back into his place
down one side of his face the flesh was darkening
his mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with a black hole in the middle of it
from time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls
his grey eyes still flitted from face to face more guiltily than ever as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation
the door opened
with a small gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced man
room 101 he said
there was a gasp and a flurry at winston 's side
the man had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor with his hand clasped together
comrade !
officer ! he cried
you don't have to take me to that place !
haven't i told you everything already ?
what else is it you want to know ?
there 's nothing i wouldn't confess nothing !
just tell me what it is and i 'll confess straight off
write it down and i 'll sign it - anything !
not room 101 !
room 101 said the officer
the man 's face already very pale turned a colour winston would not have believed possible
it was definitely unmistakably a shade of green
do anything to me ! he yelled
you 've been starving me for weeks
finish it off and let me die
shoot me
hang me
sentence me to twenty-five years
is there somebody else you want me to give away ?
just say who it is and i 'll tell you anything you want
i don't care who it is or what you do to them
i 've got a wife and three children
the biggest of them isn't six years old
you can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes and i 'll stand by and watch it
but not room 101 !
room 101 said the officer
the man looked frantically round at the other prisoners as though with some idea that he could put another victim in his own place
his eyes settled on the smashed face of the chinless man
he flung out a lean arm
that 's the one you ought to be taking not me ! he shouted
you didn't hear what he was saying after they bashed his face
give me a chance and i 'll tell you every word of it
he 's the one that 's against the party not me
the guards stepped forward
the man 's voice rose to a shriek
you didn't hear him ! he repeated
something went wrong with the telescreen
he 's the one you want
take him not me !
the two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms
but just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench
he had set up a wordless howling like an animal
the guards took hold of him to wrench him loose but he clung on with astonishing strength
for perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him
the prisoners sat quiet their hands crossed on their knees looking straight in front of them
the howling stopped ; the man had no breath left for anything except hanging on
then there was a different kind of cry
a kick from a guard 's boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands
they dragged him to his feet
room 101 said the officer
the man was led out walking unsteadily with head sunken nursing his crushed hand all the fight had gone out of him
a long time passed
if it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was taken away it was morning : if morning it was afternoon
winston was alone and had been alone for hours
the pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about unreproved by the telescreen
the piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it
at the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it but presently hunger gave way to thirst
his mouth was sticky and evil-tasting
the humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness an empty feeling inside his head
he would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet
whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned
sometimes with a fading hope he thought of o'brien and the razor blade
it was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food if he were ever fed
more dimly he thought of julia
somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he
she might be screaming with pain at this moment
he thought : if i could save julia by doubling my own pain would i do it ?
yes i would
but that was merely an intellectual decision taken because he knew that he ought to take it
he did not feel it
in this place you could not feel anything except pain and foreknowledge of pain
besides was it possible when you were actually suffering it to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase ?
but that question was not answerable yet
the boots were approaching again
the door opened
o'brien came in
winston started to his feet
the shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him
for the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen
they 've got you too ! he cried
they got me a long time ago said o'brien with a mild almost regretful irony
he stepped aside
from behind him there emerged a broad-chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand
you know him winston said o'brien
don't deceive yourself
you did know it - you have always known it
yes he saw now he had always known it
but there was no time to think of that
all he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard 's hand
it might fall anywhere ; on the crown on the tip of the ear on the upper arm on the elbow -
the elbow !
he had slumped to his knees almost paralysed clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand
everything had exploded into yellow light
inconceivable inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain !
the light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him
the guard was laughing at his contortions
one question at any rate was answered
never for any reason on earth could you wish for an increase of pain
of pain you could wish only one thing : that it should stop
nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain
in the face of pain there are no heroes no heroes he thought over and over as he writhed on the floor clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm
he was lying on something that felt like a camp bed except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move
light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face
o'brien was standing at his side looking down at him intently
at the other side of him stood a man in a white coat holding a hypodermic syringe
even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually
he had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world a sort of underwater world far beneath it
how long he had been down there he did not know
since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight
besides his memories were not continuous
there had been times when consciousness even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval
but whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds there was no way of knowing
with that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started
later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected
there was a long range of crimes - espionage sabotage and the like - to which everyone had to confess as a matter of course
the confession was a formality though the torture was real
how many times he had been beaten how long the beatings had continued he could not remember
always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously
sometimes it was fists sometimes it was truncheons sometimes it was steel rods sometimes it was boots
there were times when he rolled about the floor as shameless as an animal writhing his body this way and that in an endless hopeless effort to dodge the kicks and simply inviting more and yet more kicks in his ribs in his belly on his elbows on his shins in his groin in his testicles on the bone at the base of his spine
there were times when it went on and on until the cruel wicked unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness
there were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes
there were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise when he said to himself : i will confess but not yet
i must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable
three more kicks two more kicks and then i will tell them what they want
sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell left to recuperate for a few hours and then taken out and beaten again
there were also longer periods of recovery
he remembered them dimly because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor
he remembered a cell with a plank bed a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall and a tin wash-basin and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee
he remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair and businesslike unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse tapping his reflexes turning up his eyelids running harsh fingers over him in search for broken bones and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep
the beatings grew less frequent and became mainly a threat a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory
his questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but party intellectuals little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted - he thought he could not be sure - ten or twelve hours at a stretch
these other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on
they slapped his face wrung his ears pulled his hair made him stand on one leg refused him leave to urinate shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water ; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning
their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on hour after hour tripping him up laying traps for him twisting everything that he said convicting him at every step of lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single session
most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again ; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune call him comrade appeal to him in the name of ingsoc and big brother and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done
when his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears
in the end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards
he became simply a mouth that uttered a hand that signed whatever was demanded of him
his sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess and then confess it quickly before the bullying started anew
he confessed to the assassination of eminent party members the distribution of seditious pamphlets embezzlement of public funds sale of military secrets sabotage of every kind
he confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as 1968
he confessed that he was a religious believer an admirer of capitalism and a sexual pervert
he confessed that he had murdered his wife although he knew and his questioners must have known that his wife was still alive
he confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known
it was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody
besides in a sense it was all true
it was true that he had been the enemy of the party and in the eyes of the party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed
there were also memories of another kind
they stood out in his mind disconnectedly like pictures with blackness all round them
he was in a cell which might have been either dark or light because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes
near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly
the eyes grew larger and more luminous
suddenly he floated out of his seat dived into the eyes and was swallowed up
he was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials under dazzling lights
a man in a white coat was reading the dials
there was a tramp of heavy boots outside
the door clanged open
the waxed-faced officer marched in followed by two guards
room 101 said the officer
the man in the white coat did not turn round
he did not look at winston either ; he was looking only at the dials
he was rolling down a mighty corridor a kilometre wide full of glorious golden light roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice
he was confessing everything even the things he had succeeded in holding back under the torture
he was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already
with him were the guards the other questioners the men in white coats o'brien julia mr charrington all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with laughter
some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened
everything was all right there was no more pain the last detail of his life was laid bare understood forgiven
he was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had heard o'brien 's voice
all through his interrogation although he had never seen him he had had the feeling that o'brien was at his elbow just out of sight
it was o'brien who was directing everything
it was he who set the guards on to winston and who prevented them from killing him
it was he who decided when winston should scream with pain when he should have a respite when he should be fed when he should sleep when the drugs should be pumped into his arm
it was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers
he was the tormentor he was the protector he was the inquisitor he was the friend
and once - winston could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep or in normal sleep or even in a moment of wakefulness - a voice murmured in his ear : don't worry winston ; you are in my keeping
for seven years i have watched over you
now the turning-point has come
i shall save you i shall make you perfect
he was not sure whether it was o'brien 's voice ; but it was the same voice that had said to him we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness in that other dream seven years ago
he did not remember any ending to his interrogation
there was a period of blackness and then the cell or room in which he now was had gradually materialized round him
he was almost flat on his back and unable to move
his body was held down at every essential point
even the back of his head was gripped in some manner
o'brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly
his face seen from below looked coarse and worn with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin
he was older than winston had thought him ; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty
under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round the face
i told you said o'brien that if we met again it would be here
yes said winston
without any warning except a slight movement of o'brien 's hand a wave of pain flooded his body
it was a frightening pain because he could not see what was happening and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done to him
he did not know whether the thing was really happening or whether the effect was electrically produced ; but his body was being wrenched out of shape the joints were being slowly torn apart
although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead the worst of all was the fear that his backbone was about to snap
he set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose trying to keep silent as long as possible
you are afraid said o'brien watching his face that in another moment something is going to break
your especial fear is that it will be your backbone
you have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them
that is what you are thinking is it not winston ?
winston did not answer
o'brien drew back the lever on the dial
the wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come
that was forty said o'brien
you can see that the numbers on this dial run up to a hundred
will you please remember throughout our conversation that i have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree i choose ?
if you tell me any lies or attempt to prevaricate in any way or even fall below your usual level of intelligence you will cry out with pain instantly
do you understand that ?
yes said winston
o'brien 's manner became less severe
he resettled his spectacles thoughtfully and took a pace or two up and down
when he spoke his voice was gentle and patient
he had the air of a doctor a teacher even a priest anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish
i am taking trouble with you winston he said because you are worth trouble
you know perfectly well what is the matter with you
you have known it for years though you have fought against the knowledge
you are mentally deranged
you suffer from a defective memory
you are unable to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened
fortunately it is curable
you have never cured yourself of it because you did not choose to
there was a small effort of the will that you were not ready to make
even now i am well aware you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue
now we will take an example
at this moment which power is oceania at war with ?
when i was arrested oceania was at war with eastasia
with eastasia
good
and oceania has always been at war with eastasia has it not ?
winston drew in his breath
he opened his mouth to speak and then did not speak
he could not take his eyes away from the dial
the truth please winston
your truth
tell me what you think you remember
i remember that until only a week before i was arrested we were not at war with eastasia at all
we were in alliance with them
the war was against eurasia
that had lasted for four years
before that -
o'brien stopped him with a movement of the hand
another example he said
some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed
you believed that three men three one-time party members named jones aaronson and rutherford men who were executed for treachery and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession - were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with
you believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were false
there was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination
you believed that you had actually held it in your hands
it was a photograph something like this
an oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between o'brien 's fingers
for perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of winston 's vision
it was a photograph and there was no question of its identity
it was the photograph
it was another copy of the photograph of jones aaronson and rutherford at the party function in new york which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed
for only an instant it was before his eyes then it was out of sight again
but he had seen it unquestionably he had seen it !
he made a desperate agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free
it was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction
for the moment he had even forgotten the dial
all he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again or at least to see it
it exists ! he cried
no said o'brien
he stepped across the room
there was a memory hole in the opposite wall
o'brien lifted the grating
unseen the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air ; it was vanishing in a flash of flame
o'brien turned away from the wall
ashes he said
not even identifiable ashes
dust
it does not exist
it never existed
but it did exist !
it does exist !
it exists in memory
i remember it
you remember it
i do not remember it said o'brien
winston 's heart sank
that was doublethink
he had a feeling of deadly helplessness
if he could have been certain that o'brien was lying it would not have seemed to matter
but it was perfectly possible that o'brien had really forgotten the photograph
and if so then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it and forgotten the act of forgetting
how could one be sure that it was simple trickery ?
perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen : that was the thought that defeated him
o'brien was looking down at him speculatively
more than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child
there is a party slogan dealing with the control of the past he said
repeat it if you please
who controls the past controls the future : who controls the present controls the past repeated winston obediently
who controls the present controls the past said o'brien nodding his head with slow approval
is it your opinion winston that the past has real existence ?
again the feeling of helplessness descended upon winston
his eyes flitted towards the dial
he not only did not know whether yes or no was the answer that would save him from pain ; he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true one
o'brien smiled faintly
you are no metaphysician winston he said
until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence
i will put it more precisely
does the past exist concretely in space ?
is there somewhere or other a place a world of solid objects where the past is still happening ?
no
then where does the past exist if at all ?
in records
it is written down
in records
and - ?
in the mind
in human memories
in memory
very well then
we the party control all records and we control all memories
then we control the past do we not ?
but how can you stop people remembering things ?
cried winston again momentarily forgetting the dial
it is involuntary
it is outside oneself
how can you control memory ?
you have not controlled mine !
o'brien 's manner grew stern again
he laid his hand on the dial
on the contrary he said you have not controlled it
that is what has brought you here
you are here because you have failed in humility in self-discipline
you would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity
you preferred to be a lunatic a minority of one
only the disciplined mind can see reality winston
you believe that reality is something objective external existing in its own right
you also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident
when you delude yourself into thinking that you see something you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you
but i tell you winston that reality is not external
reality exists in the human mind and nowhere else
not in the individual mind which can make mistakes and in any case soon perishes : only in the mind of the party which is collective and immortal
whatever the party holds to be the truth is truth
it is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the party
that is the fact that you have got to relearn winston
it needs an act of self-destruction an effort of the will
you must humble yourself before you can become sane
he paused for a few moments as though to allow what he had been saying to sink in
do you remember he went on writing in your diary freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four ?
yes said winston
o'brien held up his left hand its back towards winston with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended
how many fingers am i holding up winston ?
four
and if the party says that it is not four but five - then how many ?
four
the word ended in a gasp of pain
the needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five
the sweat had sprung out all over winston 's body
the air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop
o'brien watched him the four fingers still extended
he drew back the lever
this time the pain was only slightly eased
how many fingers winston ?
four
the needle went up to sixty
how many fingers winston ?
four !
four !
what else can i say ?
four !
the needle must have risen again but he did not look at it
the heavy stern face and the four fingers filled his vision
the fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars enormous blurry and seeming to vibrate but unmistakably four
how many fingers winston ?
four !
stop it stop it !
how can you go on ?
four !
four !
how many fingers winston ?
five !
five !
five !
no winston that is no use
you are lying
you still think there are four
how many fingers please ?
four !
five !
four !
anything you like
only stop it stop the pain !
abruptly he was sitting up with o'brien 's arm round his shoulders
he had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds
the bonds that had held his body down were loosened
he felt very cold he was shaking uncontrollably his teeth were chattering the tears were rolling down his cheeks
for a moment he clung to o'brien like a baby curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders
he had the feeling that o'brien was his protector that the pain was something that came from outside from some other source and that it was o'brien who would save him from it
you are a slow learner winston said o'brien gently
how can i help it ?
he blubbered
how can i help seeing what is in front of my eyes ?
two and two are four
sometimes winston
sometimes they are five
sometimes they are three
sometimes they are all of them at once
you must try harder
it is not easy to become sane
he laid winston down on the bed
the grip of his limbs tightened again but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped leaving him merely weak and cold
o'brien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings
the man in the white coat bent down and looked closely into winston 's eyes felt his pulse laid an ear against his chest tapped here and there then he nodded to o'brien
again said o'brien
the pain flowed into winston 's body
the needle must be at seventy seventy-five
he had shut his eyes this time
he knew that the fingers were still there and still four
all that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was over
he had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not
the pain lessened again
he opened his eyes
o'brien had drawn back the lever
how many fingers winston ?
four
i suppose there are four
i would see five if i could
i am trying to see five
which do you wish : to persuade me that you see five or really to see them ?
really to see them
again said o'brien
perhaps the needle was eighty - ninety
winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening
behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance weaving in and out disappearing behind one another and reappearing again
he was trying to count them he could not remember why
he knew only that it was impossible to count them and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four
the pain died down again
when he opened his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing
innumerable fingers like moving trees were still streaming past in either direction crossing and recrossing
he shut his eyes again
how many fingers am i holding up winston ?
i don't know
i don't know
you will kill me if you do that again
four five six - in all honesty i don't know
better said o'brien
a needle slid into winston 's arm
almost in the same instant a blissful healing warmth spread all through his body
the pain was already half-forgotten
he opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at o'brien
at sight of the heavy lined face so ugly and so intelligent his heart seemed to turn over
if he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on o'brien arm
he had never loved him so deeply as at this moment and not merely because he had stopped the pain
the old feeling that it bottom it did not matter whether o'brien was a friend or an enemy had come back
o'brien was a person who could be talked to
perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood
o'brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy and in a little while it was certain he would send him to his death
it made no difference
in some sense that went deeper than friendship they were intimates : somewhere or other although the actual words might never be spoken there was a place where they could meet and talk
o'brien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind
when he spoke it was in an easy conversational tone
do you know where you are winston ?
he said
i don't know
i can guess
in the ministry of love
do you know how long you have been here ?
i don't know
days weeks months - i think it is months
and why do you imagine that we bring people to this place ?
to make them confess
no that is not the reason
try again
to punish them
no ! exclaimed o'brien
his voice had changed extraordinarily and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated
no !
not merely to extract your confession not to punish you
shall i tell you why we have brought you here ?
to cure you !
to make you sane !
will you understand winston that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured ?
we are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed
the party is not interested in the overt act : the thought is all we care about
we do not merely destroy our enemies we change them
do you understand what i mean by that ?
he was bending over winston
his face looked enormous because of its nearness and hideously ugly because it was seen from below
moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation a lunatic intensity
again winston 's heart shrank
if it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed
he felt certain that o'brien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness
at this moment however o'brien turned away
he took a pace or two up and down
then he continued less vehemently :
the first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms
you have read of the religious persecutions of the past
in the middle ages there was the inquisition
it was a failure
it set out to eradicate heresy and ended by perpetuating it
for every heretic it burned at the stake thousands of others rose up
why was that ?
because the inquisition killed its enemies in the open and killed them while they were still unrepentant : in fact it killed them because they were unrepentant
men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs
naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the inquisitor who burned him
later in the twentieth century there were the totalitarians as they were called
there were the german nazis and the russian communists
the russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the inquisition had done
and they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past ; they knew at any rate that one must not make martyrs
before they exposed their victims to public trial they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity
they wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable cringing wretches confessing whatever was put into their mouths covering themselves with abuse accusing and sheltering behind one another whimpering for mercy
and yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again
the dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten
once again why was it ?
in the first place because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue
we do not make mistakes of that kind
all the confessions that are uttered here are true
we make them true
and above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us
you must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you winston
posterity will never hear of you
you will be lifted clean out from the stream of history
we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere
nothing will remain of you not a name in a register not a memory in a living brain
you will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future
you will never have existed
then why bother to torture me ?
thought winston with a momentary bitterness
o'brien checked his step as though winston had uttered the thought aloud
his large ugly face came nearer with the eyes a little narrowed
you are thinking he said that since we intend to destroy you utterly so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference - in that case why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first ?
that is what you were thinking was it not ?
yes said winston
o'brien smiled slightly
you are a flaw in the pattern winston
you are a stain that must be wiped out
did i not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past ?
we are not content with negative obedience nor even with the most abject submission
when finally you surrender to us it must be of your own free will
we do not destroy the heretic because he resists us : so long as he resists us we never destroy him
we convert him we capture his inner mind we reshape him
we burn all evil and all illusion out of him ; we bring him over to our side not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul
we make him one of ourselves before we kill him
it is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world however secret and powerless it may be
even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation
in the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic proclaiming his heresy exulting in it
even the victim of the russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet
but we make the brain perfect before we blow it out
the command of the old despotisms was thou shalt not
the command of the totalitarians was thou shalt
our command is thou art
no one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us
everyone is washed clean
even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed - jones aaronson and rutherford - in the end we broke them down
i took part in their interrogation myself
i saw them gradually worn down whimpering grovelling weeping - and in the end it was not with pain or fear only with penitence
by the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men
there was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done and love of big brother
it was touching to see how they loved him
they begged to be shot quickly so that they could die while their minds were still clean
his voice had grown almost dreamy
the exaltation the lunatic enthusiasm was still in his face
he is not pretending thought winston he is not a hypocrite he believes every word he says
what most oppressed him was the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority
he watched the heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro in and out of the range of his vision
o'brien was a being in all ways larger than himself
there was no idea that he had ever had or could have that o'brien had not long ago known examined and rejected
his mind contained winston 's mind
but in that case how could it be true that o'brien was mad ?
it must be he winston who was mad
o'brien halted and looked down at him
his voice had grown stern again
do not imagine that you will save yourself winston however completely you surrender to us
no one who has once gone astray is ever spared
and even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life still you would never escape from us
what happens to you here is for ever
understand that in advance
we shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back
things will happen to you from which you could not recover if you lived a thousand years
never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling
everything will be dead inside you
never again will you be capable of love or friendship or joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity
you will be hollow
we shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves
he paused and signed to the man in the white coat
winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head
o'brien had sat down beside the bed so that his face was almost on a level with winston 's
three thousand he said speaking over winston 's head to the man in the white coat
two soft pads which felt slightly moist clamped themselves against winston 's temples
he quailed
there was pain coming a new kind of pain
o'brien laid a hand reassuringly almost kindly on his
this time it will not hurt he said
keep your eyes fixed on mine
at this moment there was a devastating explosion or what seemed like an explosion though it was not certain whether there was any noise
there was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light
winston was not hurt only prostrated
although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position
a terrific painless blow had flattened him out
also something had happened inside his head
as his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was and where he was and recognized the face that was gazing into his own ; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness as though a piece had been taken out of his brain
it will not last said o'brien
look me in the eyes
what country is oceania at war with ?
winston thought
he knew what was meant by oceania and that he himself was a citizen of oceania
he also remembered eurasia and eastasia ; but who was at war with whom he did not know
in fact he had not been aware that there was any war
i don't remember
oceania is at war with eastasia
do you remember that now ?
yes
oceania has always been at war with eastasia
since the beginning of your life since the beginning of the party since the beginning of history the war has continued without a break always the same war
do you remember that ?
yes
eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been condemned to death for treachery
you pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent
no such piece of paper ever existed
you invented it and later you grew to believe in it
you remember now the very moment at which you first invented it
do you remember that ?
yes
just now i held up the fingers of my hand to you
you saw five fingers
do you remember that ?
yes
o'brien held up the fingers of his left hand with the thumb concealed
there are five fingers there
do you see five fingers ?
yes
and he did see them for a fleeting instant before the scenery of his mind changed
he saw five fingers and there was no deformity
then everything was normal again and the old fear the hatred and the bewilderment came crowding back again
but there had been a moment - he did not know how long thirty seconds perhaps - of luminous certainty when each new suggestion of o'brien 's had filled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth and when two and two could have been three as easily as five if that were what was needed
it had faded but before o'brien had dropped his hand ; but though he could not recapture it he could remember it as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of one 's life when one was in effect a different person
you see now said o'brien that it is at any rate possible
yes said winston
o'brien stood up with a satisfied air
over to his left winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe
o'brien turned to winston with a smile
in almost the old manner he resettled his spectacles on his nose
do you remember writing in your diary he said that it did not matter whether i was a friend or an enemy since i was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to ?
you were right
i enjoy talking to you
your mind appeals to me
it resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane
before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions if you choose
any question i like ?
anything
he saw that winston 's eyes were upon the dial
it is switched off
what is your first question ?
what have you done with julia ?
said winston
o'brien smiled again
she betrayed you winston
immediately - unreservedly
i have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly
you would hardly recognize her if you saw her
all her rebelliousness her deceit her folly her dirty-mindedness - everything has been burned out of her
it was a perfect conversion a textbook case
you tortured her ?
o'brien left this unanswered
next question he said
does big brother exist ?
of course he exists
the party exists
big brother is the embodiment of the party
does he exist in the same way as i exist ?
you do not exist said o'brien
once again the sense of helplessness assailed him
he knew or he could imagine the arguments which proved his own nonexistence ; but they were nonsense they were only a play on words
did not the statement you do not exist contain a logical absurdity ?
but what use was it to say so ?
his mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable mad arguments with which o'brien would demolish him
i think i exist he said wearily
i am conscious of my own identity
i was born and i shall die
i have arms and legs
i occupy a particular point in space
no other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously
in that sense does big brother exist ?
it is of no importance
he exists
will big brother ever die ?
of course not
how could he die ?
next question
does the brotherhood exist ?
that winston you will never know
if we choose to set you free when we have finished with you and if you live to be ninety years old still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is yes or no
as long as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind
winston lay silent
his breast rose and fell a little faster
he still had not asked the question that had come into his mind the first
he had got to ask it and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it
there was a trace of amusement in o'brien 's face
even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam
he knows thought winston suddenly he knows what i am going to ask !
at the thought the words burst out of him :
what is in room 101 ?
the expression on o'brien 's face did not change
he answered drily :
you know what is in room 101 winston
everyone knows what is in room 101
he raised a finger to the man in the white coat
evidently the session was at an end
a needle jerked into winston 's arm
he sank almost instantly into deep sleep
there are three stages in your reintegration said o'brien
there is learning there is understanding and there is acceptance
it is time for you to enter upon the second stage
as always winston was lying flat on his back
but of late his bonds were looser
they still held him to the bed but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow
the dial also had grown to be less of a terror
he could evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough : it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that o'brien pulled the lever
sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial
he could not remember how many sessions there had been
the whole process seemed to stretch out over a long indefinite time - weeks possibly - and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days sometimes only an hour or two
as you lie there said o'brien you have often wondered you have even asked me - why the ministry of love should expend so much time and trouble on you
and when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question
you could grasp the mechanics of the society you lived in but not its underlying motives
do you remember writing in your diary i understand how : i do not understand why ?
it was when you thought about why that you doubted your own sanity
you have read the book goldstein 's book or parts of it at least
did it tell you anything that you did not know already ?
you have read it ?
said winston
i wrote it
that is to say i collaborated in writing it
no book is produced individually as you know
is it true what it says ?
a description yes
the programme it sets forth is nonsense
the secret accumulation of knowledge - a gradual spread of enlightenment - ultimately a proletarian rebellion - the overthrow of the party
you foresaw yourself that that was what it would say
it is all nonsense
the proletarians will never revolt not in a thousand years or a million
they cannot
i do not have to tell you the reason : you know it already
if you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection you must abandon them
there is no way in which the party can be overthrown
the rule of the party is for ever
make that the starting-point of your thoughts
he came closer to the bed
for ever ! he repeated
and now let us get back to the question of how and why
you understand well enough how the party maintains itself in power
now tell me why we cling to power
what is our motive ?
why should we want power ?
go on speak he added as winston remained silent
nevertheless winston did not speak for another moment or two
a feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him
the faint mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into o'brien 's face
he knew in advance what o'brien would say
that the party did not seek power for its own ends but only for the good of the majority
that it sought power because men in the mass were frail cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves
that the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness and that for the great bulk of mankind happiness was better
that the party was the eternal guardian of the weak a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come sacrificing its own happiness to that of others
the terrible thing thought winston the terrible thing was that when o'brien said this he would believe it
you could see it in his face
o'brien knew everything
a thousand times better than winston he knew what the world was really like in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the party kept them there
he had understood it all weighed it all and it made no difference : all was justified by the ultimate purpose
what can you do thought winston against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy ?
you are ruling over us for our own good he said feebly
you believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves and therefore -
he started and almost cried out
a pang of pain had shot through his body
o'brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five
that was stupid winston stupid ! he said
you should know better than to say a thing like that
he pulled the lever back and continued :
now i will tell you the answer to my question
it is this
the party seeks power entirely for its own sake
we are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power
not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness : only power pure power
what pure power means you will understand presently
we are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing
all the others even those who resembled ourselves were - cowards and hypocrites
the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives
they pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal
we are not like that
we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it
power is not a means it is an end
one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution ; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship
the object of persecution is persecution
the object of torture is torture
the object of power is power
now do you begin to understand me ?
winston was struck as he had been struck before by the tiredness of o'brien 's face
it was strong and fleshy and brutal it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless ; but it was tired
there were pouches under the eyes the skin sagged from the cheekbones
o'brien leaned over him deliberately bringing the worn face nearer
you are thinking he said that my face is old and tired
you are thinking that i talk of power and yet i am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body
can you not understand winston that the individual is only a cell ?
the weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism
do you die when you cut your fingernails ?
he turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again one hand in his pocket
we are the priests of power he said
god is power
but at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned
it is time for you to gather some idea of what power means
the first thing you must realize is that power is collective
the individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual
you know the party slogan : freedom is slavery
has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible ?
slavery is freedom
alone - free - the human being is always defeated
it must be so because every human being is doomed to die which is the greatest of all failures
but if he can make complete utter submission if he can escape from his identity if he can merge himself in the party so that he is the party then he is all-powerful and immortal
the second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings
over the body but above all over the mind
power over matter - external reality as you would call it - is not important
already our control over matter is absolute
for a moment winston ignored the dial
he made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully
but how can you control matter ?
he burst out
you don't even control the climate or the law of gravity
and there are disease pain death -
o'brien silenced him by a movement of his hand
we control matter because we control the mind
reality is inside the skull
you will learn by degrees winston
there is nothing that we could not do
invisibility levitation - anything
i could float off this floor like a soap bubble if i wish to
i do not wish to because the party does not wish it
you must get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of nature
we make the laws of nature
but you do not !
you are not even masters of this planet
what about eurasia and eastasia ?
you have not conquered them yet
unimportant
we shall conquer them when it suits us
and if we did not what difference would it make ?
we can shut them out of existence
oceania is the world
but the world itself is only a speck of dust
and man is tiny helpless !
how long has he been in existence ?
for millions of years the earth was uninhabited
nonsense
the earth is as old as we are no older
how could it be older ?
nothing exists except through human consciousness
but the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals - mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of
have you ever seen those bones winston ?
of course not
nineteenth-century biologists invented them
before man there was nothing
after man if he could come to an end there would be nothing
outside man there is nothing
but the whole universe is outside us
look at the stars !
some of them are a million light-years away
they are out of our reach for ever
what are the stars ?
said o'brien indifferently
they are bits of fire a few kilometres away
we could reach them if we wanted to
or we could blot them out
the earth is the centre of the universe
the sun and the stars go round it
winston made another convulsive movement
this time he did not say anything
o'brien continued as though answering a spoken objection :
for certain purposes of course that is not true
when we navigate the ocean or when we predict an eclipse we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away
but what of it ?
do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy ?
the stars can be near or distant according as we need them
do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that ?
have you forgotten doublethink ?
winston shrank back upon the bed
whatever he said the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon
and yet he knew he knew that he was in the right
the belief that nothing exists outside your own mind - surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false ?
had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy ?
there was even a name for it which he had forgotten
a faint smile twitched the corners of o'brien 's mouth as he looked down at him
i told you winston he said that metaphysics is not your strong point
the word you are trying to think of is solipsism
but you are mistaken
this is not solipsism
collective solipsism if you like
but that is a different thing : in fact the opposite thing
all this is a digression he added in a different tone
the real power the power we have to fight for night and day is not power over things but over men
he paused and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil : how does one man assert his power over another winston ?
winston thought
by making him suffer he said
exactly
by making him suffer
obedience is not enough
unless he is suffering how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own ?
power is in inflicting pain and humiliation
power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing
do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating ?
it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined
a world of fear and treachery is torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself
progress in our world will be progress towards more pain
the old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice
ours is founded upon hatred
in our world there will be no emotions except fear rage triumph and self-abasement
everything else we shall destroy everything
already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution
we have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman
no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer
but in the future there will be no wives and no friends
children will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a hen
the sex instinct will be eradicated
procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card
we shall abolish the orgasm
our neurologists are at work upon it now
there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party
there will be no love except the love of big brother
there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy
there will be no art no literature no science
when we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science
there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness
there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life
all competing pleasures will be destroyed
but always - do not forget this winston - always there will be the intoxication of power constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler
always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless
if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face - for ever
he paused as though he expected winston to speak
winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again
he could not say anything
his heart seemed to be frozen
o'brien went on :
and remember that it is for ever
the face will always be there to be stamped upon
the heretic the enemy of society will always be there so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again
everything that you have undergone since you have been in our hands - all that will continue and worse
the espionage the betrayals the arrests the tortures the executions the disappearances will never cease
it will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph
the more the party is powerful the less it will be tolerant : the weaker the opposition the tighter the despotism
goldstein and his heresies will live for ever
every day at every moment they will be defeated discredited ridiculed spat upon and yet they will always survive
this drama that i have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation always in subtler forms
always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy screaming with pain broken up contemptible - and in the end utterly penitent saved from himself crawling to our feet of his own accord
that is the world that we are preparing winston
a world of victory after victory triumph after triumph after triumph : an endless pressing pressing pressing upon the nerve of power
you are beginning i can see to realize what that world will be like
but in the end you will do more than understand it
you will accept it welcome it become part of it
winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak
you can't ! he said weakly
what do you mean by that remark winston ?
you could not create such a world as you have just described
it is a dream
it is impossible
why ?
it is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty
it would never endure
why not ?
it would have no vitality
it would disintegrate
it would commit suicide
nonsense
you are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love
why should it be ?
and if it were what difference would that make ?
suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster
suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty
still what difference would it make ?
can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death ?
the party is immortal
as usual the voice had battered winston into helplessness
moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement o'brien would twist the dial again
and yet he could not keep silent
feebly without arguments with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what o'brien had said he returned to the attack
i don't know - i don't care
somehow you will fail
something will defeat you
life will defeat you
we control life winston at all its levels
you are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us
but we create human nature
men are infinitely malleable
or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us
put it out of your mind
they are helpless like the animals
humanity is the party
the others are outside - irrelevant
i don't care
in the end they will beat you
sooner or later they will see you for what you are and then they will tear you to pieces
do you see any evidence that that is happening ?
or any reason why it should ?
no
i believe it
i know that you will fail
there is something in the universe - i don't know some spirit some principle - that you will never overcome
do you believe in god winston ?
no
then what is it this principle that will defeat us ?
i don't know
the spirit of man
and do you consider yourself a man ?
yes
if you are a man winston you are the last man
your kind is extinct ; we are the inheritors
do you understand that you are alone ?
you are outside history you are non-existent
his manner changed and he said more harshly : and you consider yourself morally superior to us with our lies and our cruelty ?
yes i consider myself superior
o'brien did not speak
two other voices were speaking
after a moment winston recognized one of them as his own
it was a sound-track of the conversation he had had with o'brien on the night when he had enrolled himself in the brotherhood
he heard himself promising to lie to steal to forge to murder to encourage drug-taking and prostitution to disseminate venereal diseases to throw vitriol in a child 's face
o'brien made a small impatient gesture as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making
then he turned a switch and the voices stopped
get up from that bed he said
the bonds had loosened themselves
winston lowered himself to the floor and stood up unsteadily
you are the last man said o'brien
you are the guardian of the human spirit
you shall see yourself as you are
take off your clothes
winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together
the zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of them
he could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time
beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes
as he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room
he approached it then stopped short
an involuntary cry had broken out of him
go on said o'brien
stand between the wings of the mirror
you shall see the side view as well
he had stopped because he was frightened
a bowed greycoloured skeleton-like thing was coming towards him
its actual appearance was frightening and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself
he moved closer to the glass
the creature 's face seemed to be protruded because of its bent carriage
a forlorn jailbird 's face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp a crooked nose and battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful
the cheeks were seamed the mouth had a drawn-in look
certainly it was his own face but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside
the emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt
he had gone partially bald
for the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well but it was only the scalp that was grey
except for his hands and a circle of his face his body was grey all over with ancient ingrained dirt
here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it
but the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body
the barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton : the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs
he saw now what o'brien had meant about seeing the side view
the curvature of the spine was astonishing
the thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull
at a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty suffering from some malignant disease
you have thought sometimes said o'brien that my face - the face of a member of the inner party - looks old and worn
what do you think of your own face ?
he seized winston 's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him
look at the condition you are in ! he said
look at this filthy grime all over your body
look at the dirt between your toes
look at that disgusting running sore on your leg
do you know that you stink like a goat ?
probably you have ceased to notice it
look at your emaciation
do you see ?
i can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep
i could snap your neck like a carrot
do you know that you have lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our hands ?
even your hair is coming out in handfuls
look !
he plucked at winston 's head and brought away a tuft of hair
open your mouth
nine ten eleven teeth left
how many had you when you came to us ?
and the few you have left are dropping out of your head
look here !
he seized one of winston 's remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb and forefinger
a twinge of pain shot through winston 's jaw
o'brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots
he tossed it across the cell
you are rotting away he said ; you are falling to pieces
what are you ?
a bag of filth
now turn around and look into that mirror again
do you see that thing facing you ?
that is the last man
if you are human that is humanity
now put your clothes on again
winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements
until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was
only one thought stirred in his mind : that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined
then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him
before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears
he was aware of his ugliness his gracelessness a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light : but he could not stop himself
o'brien laid a hand on his shoulder almost kindly
it will not last for ever he said
you can escape from it whenever you choose
everything depends on yourself
you did it ! sobbed winston
you reduced me to this state
no winston you reduced yourself to it
this is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the party
it was all contained in that first act
nothing has happened that you did not foresee
he paused and then went on :
we have beaten you winston
we have broken you up
you have seen what your body is like
your mind is in the same state
i do not think there can be much pride left in you
you have been kicked and flogged and insulted you have screamed with pain you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit
you have whimpered for mercy you have betrayed everybody and everything
can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you ?
winston had stopped weeping though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes
he looked up at o'brien
i have not betrayed julia he said
o'brien looked down at him thoughtfully
no he said ; no ; that is perfectly true
you have not betrayed julia
the peculiar reverence for o'brien which nothing seemed able to destroy flooded winston 's heart again
how intelligent he thought how intelligent !
never did o'brien fail to understand what was said to him
anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed julia
for what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture ?
he had told them everything he knew about her her habits her character her past life ; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings all that he had said to her and she to him their black-market meals their adulteries their vague plottings against the party - everything
and yet in the sense in which he intended the word he had not betrayed her
he had not stopped loving her ; his feelings towards her had remained the same
o'brien had seen what he meant without the need for explanation
tell me he said how soon will they shoot me ?
it might be a long time said o'brien
you are a difficult case
but don't give up hope
everyone is cured sooner or later
in the end we shall shoot you
he was much better
he was growing fatter and stronger every day if it was proper to speak of days
the white light and the humming sound were the same as ever but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in
there was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed and a stool to sit on
they had given him a bath and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin
they even gave him warm water to wash with
they had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls
they had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment
they had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures
weeks or months must have passed
it would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time if he had felt any interest in doing so since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals
he was getting he judged three meals in the twenty-four hours ; sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day
the food was surprisingly good with meat at every third meal
once there was even a packet of cigarettes
he had no matches but the never-speaking guard who brought his food would give him a light
the first time he tried to smoke it made him sick but he persevered and spun the packet out for a long time smoking half a cigarette after each meal
they had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner
at first he made no use of it
even when he was awake he was completely torpid
often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring sometimes asleep sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes
he had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face
it seemed to make no difference except that one 's dreams were more coherent
he dreamed a great deal all through this time and they were always happy dreams
he was in the golden country or he was sitting among enormous glorious sunlit ruins with his mother with julia with o'brien - not doing anything merely sitting in the sun talking of peaceful things
such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams
he seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort now that the stimulus of pain had been removed
he was not bored he had no desire for conversation or distraction
merely to be alone not to be beaten or questioned to have enough to eat and to be clean all over was completely satisfying
by degrees he came to spend less time in sleep but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed
all he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body
he would finger himself here and there trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter
finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter ; his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees
after that reluctantly at first he began exercising himself regularly
in a little while he could walk three kilometres measured by pacing the cell and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter
he attempted more elaborate exercises and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do
he could not move out of a walk he could not hold his stool out at arm 's length he could not stand on one leg without falling over
he squatted down on his heels and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position
he lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands
it was hopeless he could not raise himself a centimetre
but after a few more days - a few more mealtimes - even that feat was accomplished
a time came when he could do it six times running
he began to grow actually proud of his body and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal
only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror
his mind grew more active
he sat down on the plank bed his back against the wall and the slate on his knees and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educating himself
he had capitulated that was agreed
in reality as he saw now he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision
from the moment when he was inside the ministry of love - and yes even during those minutes when he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to do - he had grasped the frivolity the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the party
he knew now that for seven years the thought police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying glass
there was no physical act no word spoken aloud that they had not noticed no train of thought that they had not been able to infer
even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced
they had played sound-tracks to him shown him photographs
some of them were photographs of julia and himself
yes even . he could not fight against the party any longer
besides the party was in the right
it must be so ; how could the immortal collective brain be mistaken ?
by what external standard could you check its judgements ?
sanity was statistical
it was merely a question of learning to think as they thought
only !
the pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers
he began to write down the thoughts that came into his head
he wrote first in large clumsy capitals : freedom is slavery
then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it : two and two make five
but then there came a sort of check
his mind as though shying away from something seemed unable to concentrate
he knew that he knew what came next but for the moment he could not recall it
when he did recall it it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be : it did not come of its own accord
he wrote : god is power
he accepted everything
the past was alterable
the past never had been altered
oceania was at war with eastasia
oceania had always been at war with eastasia
jones aaronson and rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were charged with
he had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt
it had never existed he had invented it
he remembered remembering contrary things but those were false memories products of selfdeception
how easy it all was !
only surrender and everything else followed
it was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it
nothing had changed except your own attitude : the predestined thing happened in any case
he hardly knew why he had ever rebelled
everything was easy except - !
anything could be true
the so-called laws of nature were nonsense
the law of gravity was nonsense
if i wished o'brien had said i could float off this floor like a soap bubble
winston worked it out
if he thinks he floats off the floor and if i simultaneously think i see him do it then the thing happens
suddenly like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water the thought burst into his mind : it doesn't really happen
we imagine it
it is hallucination
he pushed the thought under instantly
the fallacy was obvious
it presupposed that somewhere or other outside oneself there was a real world where real things happened
but how could there be such a world ?
what knowledge have we of anything save through our own minds ?
all happenings are in the mind
whatever happens in all minds truly happens
he had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy and he was in no danger of succumbing to it
he realized nevertheless that it ought never to have occurred to him
the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself
the process should be automatic instinctive
crimestop they called it in newspeak
he set to work to exercise himself in crimestop
he presented himself with propositions - the party says the earth is flat the party says that ice is heavier than water - and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them
it was not easy
it needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation
the arithmetical problems raised for instance by such a statement as two and two make five were beyond his intellectual grasp
it needed also a sort of athleticism of mind an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors
stupidity was as necessary as intelligence and as difficult to attain
all the while with one part of his mind he wondered how soon they would shoot him
everything depends on yourself o'brien had said ; but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer
it might be ten minutes hence or ten years
they might keep him for years in solitary confinement they might send him to a labour-camp they might release him for a while as they sometimes did
it was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again
the one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment
the tradition - the unspoken tradition : somehow you knew it though you never heard it said - was that they shot you from behind ; always in the back of the head without warning as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell
one day - but one day was not the right expression ; just as probably it was in the middle of the night : once - he fell into a strange blissful reverie
he was walking down the corridor waiting for the bullet
he knew that it was coming in another moment
everything was settled smoothed out reconciled
there were no more doubts no more arguments no more pain no more fear
his body was healthy and strong
he walked easily with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight
he was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the ministry of love he was in the enormous sunlit passage a kilometre wide down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs
he was in the golden country following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture
he could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face
at the edge of the field were the elm trees faintly stirring and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows
suddenly he started up with a shock of horror
the sweat broke out on his backbone
he had heard himself cry aloud :
julia !
julia !
julia my love !
julia !
for a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence
she had seemed to be not merely with him but inside him
it was as though she had got into the texture of his skin
in that moment he had loved her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free
also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help
he lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself
what had he done ?
how many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness ?
in another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside
they could not let such an outburst go unpunished
they would know now if they had not known before that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them
he obeyed the party but he still hated the party
in the old days he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity
now he had retreated a step further : in the mind he had surrendered but he had hoped to keep the inner heart inviolate
he knew that he was in the wrong but he preferred to be in the wrong
they would understand that - o'brien would understand it
it was all confessed in that single foolish cry
he would have to start all over again
it might take years
he ran a hand over his face trying to familiarize himself with the new shape
there were deep furrows in the cheeks the cheekbones felt sharp the nose flattened
besides since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of teeth
it was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like
in any case mere control of the features was not enough
for the first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself
you must know all the while that it is there but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name
from now onwards he must not only think right ; he must feel right dream right
and all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him a kind of cyst
one day they would decide to shoot him
you could not tell when it would happen but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess
it was always from behind walking down a corridor
ten seconds would be enough
in that time the world inside him could turn over
and then suddenly without a word uttered without a check in his step without the changing of a line in his face - suddenly the camouflage would be down and bang ! would go the batteries of his hatred
hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame
and almost in the same instant bang ! would go the bullet too late or too early
they would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it
the heretical thought would be unpunished unrepented out of their reach for ever
they would have blown a hole in their own perfection
to die hating them that was freedom
he shut his eyes
it was more difficult than accepting an intellectual discipline
it was a question of degrading himself mutilating himself
he had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth
what was the most horrible sickening thing of all ?
he thought of big brother
the enormous face ( because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide ) with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro seemed to float into his mind of its own accord
what were his true feelings towards big brother ?
there was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage
the steel door swung open with a clang
o'brien walked into the cell
behind him were the waxen-faced officer and the black-uniformed guards
get up said o'brien
come here
winston stood opposite him
o'brien took winston 's shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him closely
you have had thoughts of deceiving me he said
that was stupid
stand up straighter
look me in the face
he paused and went on in a gentler tone :
you are improving
intellectually there is very little wrong with you
it is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress
tell me winston - and remember no lies : you know that i am always able to detect a lie - tell me what are your true feelings towards big brother ?
i hate him
you hate him
good
then the time has come for you to take the last step
you must love big brother
it is not enough to obey him : you must love him
he released winston with a little push towards the guards
room 101 he said
at each stage of his imprisonment he had known or seemed to know whereabouts he was in the windowless building
possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure
the cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level
the room where he had been interrogated by o'brien was high up near the roof
this place was many metres underground as deep down as it was possible to go
it was bigger than most of the cells he had been in
but he hardly noticed his surroundings
all he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him each covered with green baize
one was only a metre or two from him the other was further away near the door
he was strapped upright in a chair so tightly that he could move nothing not even his head
a sort of pad gripped his head from behind forcing him to look straight in front of him
for a moment he was alone then the door opened and o'brien came in
you asked me once said o'brien what was in room 101
i told you that you knew the answer already
everyone knows it
the thing that is in room 101 is the worst thing in the world
the door opened again
a guard came in carrying something made of wire a box or basket of some kind
he set it down on the further table
because of the position in which o'brien was standing winston could not see what the thing was
the worst thing in the world said o'brien varies from individual to individual
it may be burial alive or death by fire or by drowning or by impalement or fifty other deaths
there are cases where it is some quite trivial thing not even fatal
he had moved a little to one side so that winston had a better view of the thing on the table
it was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by
fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask with the concave side outwards
although it was three or four metres away from him he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments and that there was some kind of creature in each
they were rats
in your case said o'brien the worst thing in the world happens to be rats
a sort of premonitory tremor a fear of he was not certain what had passed through winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage
but at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him
his bowels seemed to turn to water
you can't do that ! he cried out in a high cracked voice
you couldn't you couldn't !
it 's impossible
do you remember said o'brien the moment of panic that used to occur in your dreams ?
there was a wall of blackness in front of you and a roaring sound in your ears
there was something terrible on the other side of the wall
you knew that you knew what it was but you dared not drag it into the open
it was the rats that were on the other side of the wall
o'brien ! said winston making an effort to control his voice
you know this is not necessary
what is it that you want me to do ?
o'brien made no direct answer
when he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected
he looked thoughtfully into the distance as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind winston 's back
by itself he said pain is not always enough
there are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain even to the point of death
but for everyone there is something unendurable - something that cannot be contemplated
courage and cowardice are not involved
if you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope
if you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air
it is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed
it is the same with the rats
for you they are unendurable
they are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand even if you wished to
you will do what is required of you
but what is it what is it ?
how can i do it if i don't know what it is ?
o'brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table
he set it down carefully on the baize cloth
winston could hear the blood singing in his ears
he had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness
he was in the middle of a great empty plain a flat desert drenched with sunlight across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances
yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him
they were enormous rats
they were at the age when a rat 's muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey
the rat said o'brien still addressing his invisible audience although a rodent is carnivorous
you are aware of that
you will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town
in some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house even for five minutes
the rats are certain to attack it
within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones
they also attack sick or dying people
they show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless
there was an outburst of squeals from the cage
it seemed to reach winston from far away
the rats were fighting ; they were trying to get at each other through the partition
he heard also a deep groan of despair
that too seemed to come from outside himself
o'brien picked up the cage and as he did so pressed something in it
there was a sharp click
winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair
it was hopeless ; every part of him even his head was held immovably
o'brien moved the cage nearer
it was less than a metre from winston 's face
i have pressed the first lever said o'brien
you understand the construction of this cage
the mask will fit over your head leaving no exit
when i press this other lever the door of the cage will slide up
these starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets
have you ever seen a rat leap through the air ?
they will leap on to your face and bore straight into it
sometimes they attack the eyes first
sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue
the cage was nearer ; it was closing in
winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head
but he fought furiously against his panic
to think to think even with a split second left - to think was the only hope
suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils
there was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him and he almost lost consciousness
everything had gone black
for an instant he was insane a screaming animal
yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea
there was one and only one way to save himself
he must interpose another human being the body of another human being between himself and the rats
the circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else
the wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face
the rats knew what was coming now
one of them was leaping up and down the other an old scaly grandfather of the sewers stood up with his pink hands against the bars and fiercely sniffed the air
winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth
again the black panic took hold of him
he was blind helpless mindless
it was a common punishment in imperial china said o'brien as didactically as ever
the mask was closing on his face
the wire brushed his cheek
and then - no it was not relief only hope a tiny fragment of hope
too late perhaps too late
but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment - one body that he could thrust between himself and the rats
and he was shouting frantically over and over
do it to julia !
do it to julia !
not me !
julia !
i don't care what you do to her
tear her face off strip her to the bones
not me !
julia !
not me !
he was falling backwards into enormous depths away from the rats
he was still strapped in the chair but he had fallen through the floor through the walls of the building through the earth through the oceans through the atmosphere into outer space into the gulfs between the stars - always away away away from the rats
he was light years distant but o'brien was still standing at his side
there was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek
but through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open
the chestnut tree was almost empty
a ray of sunlight slanting through a window fell on dusty table-tops
it was the lonely hour of fifteen
a tinny music trickled from the telescreens
winston sat in his usual corner gazing into an empty glass
now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall
big brother is watching you the caption said
unbidden a waiter came and filled his glass up with victory gin shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork
it was saccharine flavoured with cloves the speciality of the cafe
winston was listening to the telescreen
at present only music was coming out of it but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the ministry of peace
the news from the african front was disquieting in the extreme
on and off he had been worrying about it all day
a eurasian army ( oceania was at war with eurasia : oceania had always been at war with eurasia ) was moving southward at terrifying speed
the mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite area but it was probable that already the mouth of the congo was a battlefield
brazzaville and leopoldville were in danger
one did not have to look at the map to see what it meant
it was not merely a question of losing central africa : for the first time in the whole war the territory of oceania itself was menaced
a violent emotion not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement flared up in him then faded again
he stopped thinking about the war
in these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time
he picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp
as always the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly
the stuff was horrible
the cloves and saccharine themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way could not disguise the flat oily smell ; and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin which dwelt with him night and day was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those -
he never named them even in his thoughts and so far as it was possible he never visualized them
they were something that he was half-aware of hovering close to his face a smell that clung to his nostrils
as the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips
he had grown fatter since they released him and had regained his old colour - indeed more than regained it
his features had thickened the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red even the bald scalp was too deep a pink
a waiter again unbidden brought the chessboard and the current issue of the times with the page turned down at the chess problem
then seeing that winston 's glass was empty he brought the gin bottle and filled it
there was no need to give orders
they knew his habits
the chessboard was always waiting for him his corner table was always reserved ; even when the place was full he had it to himself since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him
he never even bothered to count his drinks
at irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill but he had the impression that they always undercharged him
it would have made no difference if it had been the other way about
he had always plenty of money nowadays
he even had a job a sinecure more highly-paid than his old job had been
the music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over
winston raised his head to listen
no bulletins from the front however
it was merely a brief announcement from the ministry of plenty
in the preceding quarter it appeared the tenth three year plan 's quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by 98 per cent
he examined the chess problem and set out the pieces
it was a tricky ending involving a couple of knights
white to play and mate in two moves
winston looked up at the portrait of big brother
white always mates he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism
always without exception it is so arranged
in no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won
did it not symbolize the eternal unvarying triumph of good over evil ?
the huge face gazed back at him full of calm power
white always mates
the voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone : you are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty
fifteen-thirty !
this is news of the highest importance
take care not to miss it
fifteen-thirty !
the tinking music struck up again
winston 's heart stirred
that was the bulletin from the front ; instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming
all day with little spurts of excitement the thought of a smashing defeat in africa had been in and out of his mind
he seemed actually to see the eurasian army swarming across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of africa like a column of ants
why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way ?
the outline of the west african coast stood out vividly in his mind
he picked up the white knight and moved it across the board
there was the proper spot
even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force mysteriously assembled suddenly planted in their rear cutting their communications by land and sea
he felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence
but it was necessary to act quickly
if they could get control of the whole of africa if they had airfields and submarine bases at the cape it would cut oceania in two
it might mean anything : defeat breakdown the redivision of the world the destruction of the party !
he drew a deep breath
an extraordinary medley of feeling - but it was not a medley exactly ; rather it was successive layers of feeling in which one could not say which layer was undermost struggled inside him
the spasm passed
he put the white knight back in its place but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem
his thoughts wandered again
almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table : 2+2=5
they can't get inside you she had said
but they could get inside you
what happens to you here is for ever o'brien had said
that was a true word
there were things your own acts from which you could never recover
something was killed in your breast : burnt out cauterized out
he had seen her ; he had even spoken to her
there was no danger in it
he knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings
he could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to
actually it was by chance that they had met
it was in the park on a vile biting day in march when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind
he was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him
it struck him at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way
they almost passed one another without a sign then he turned and followed her not very eagerly
he knew that there was no danger nobody would take any interest in him
she did not speak
she walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side
presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind
they halted
it was vilely cold
the wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional dirty-looking crocuses
he put his arm round her waist
there was no telescreen but there must be hidden microphones : besides they could be seen
it did not matter nothing mattered
they could have lain down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to
his flesh froze with horror at the thought of it
she made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm ; she did not even try to disengage herself
he knew now what had changed in her
her face was sallower and there was a long scar partly hidden by the hair across her forehead and temple ; but that was not the change
it was that her waist had grown thicker and in a surprising way had stiffened
he remembered how once after the explosion of a rocket bomb he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle which made it seem more like stone than flesh
her body felt like that
it occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been
he did not attempt to kiss her nor did they speak
as they walked back across the grass she looked directly at him for the first time
it was only a momentary glance full of contempt and dislike
he wondered whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes
they sat down on two iron chairs side by side but not too close together
he saw that she was about to speak
she moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig
her feet seemed to have grown broader he noticed
i betrayed you she said baldly
i betrayed you he said
she gave him another quick look of dislike
sometimes she said they threaten you with something something you can't stand up to can't even think about
and then you say don't do it to me do it to somebody else do it to so-and-so
and perhaps you might pretend afterwards that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn't really mean it
but that isn't true
at the time when it happens you do mean it
you think there 's no other way of saving yourself and you 're quite ready to save yourself that way
you want it to happen to the other person
you don't give a damn what they suffer
all you care about is yourself
all you care about is yourself he echoed
and after that you don't feel the same towards the other person any longer
no he said you don't feel the same
there did not seem to be anything more to say
the wind plastered their thin overalls against their bodies
almost at once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence : besides it was too cold to keep still
she said something about catching her tube and stood up to go
we must meet again he said
yes she said we must meet again
he followed irresolutely for a little distance half a pace behind her
they did not speak again
she did not actually try to shake him off but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her
he had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the tube station but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable
he was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree cafe which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment
he had a nostalgic vision of his corner table with the newspaper and the chessboard and the everflowing gin
above all it would be warm in there
the next moment not altogether by accident he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people
he made a halfhearted attempt to catch up then slowed down turned and made off in the opposite direction
when he had gone fifty metres he looked back
the street was not crowded but already he could not distinguish her
any one of a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers
perhaps her thickened stiffened body was no longer recognizable from behind
at the time when it happens she had said you do mean it
he had meant it
he had not merely said it he had wished it
he had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to the -
something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen
a cracked and jeering note a yellow note came into it
and then - perhaps it was not happening perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound - a voice was singing :
the tears welled up in his eyes
a passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle
he took up his glass and sniffed at it
the stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank
but it had become the element he swam in
it was his life his death and his resurrection
it was gin that sank him into stupor every night and gin that revived him every morning
when he woke seldom before eleven hundred with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight
through the midday hours he sat with glazed face the bottle handy listening to the telescreen
from fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the chestnut tree
no one cared what he did any longer no whistle woke him no telescreen admonished him
occasionally perhaps twice a week he went to a dusty forgotten-looking office in the ministry of truth and did a little work or what was called work
he had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary
they were engaged in producing something called an interim report but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out
it was something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed inside brackets or outside
there were four others on the committee all of them persons similar to himself
there were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done
but there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never finished - when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse with subtle haggling over definitions enormous digressions quarrels threats even to appeal to higher authority
and then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes like ghosts fading at cock-crow
the telescreen was silent for a moment
winston raised his head again
the bulletin !
but no they were merely changing the music
he had the map of africa behind his eyelids
the movement of the armies was a diagram : a black arrow tearing vertically southward and a white arrow horizontally eastward across the tail of the first
as though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait
was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist ?
his interest flagged again
he drank another mouthful of gin picked up the white knight and made a tentative move
check
but it was evidently not the right move because
uncalled a memory floated into his mind
he saw a candle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed and himself a boy of nine or ten sitting on the floor shaking a dice-box and laughing excitedly
his mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing
it must have been about a month before she disappeared
it was a moment of reconciliation when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived
he remembered the day well a pelting drenching day when the water streamed down the window-pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by
the boredom of the two children in the dark cramped bedroom became unbearable
winston whined and grizzled made futile demands for food fretted about the room pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall while the younger child wailed intermittently
in the end his mother said now be good and i 'll buy you a toy
a lovely toy - you 'll love it ; and then she had gone out in the rain to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of snakes and ladders
he could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard
it was a miserable outfit
the board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they would hardly lie on their sides
winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest
but then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play
soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again almost to the starting-point
they played eight games winning four each
his tiny sister too young to understand what the game was about had sat propped up against a bolster laughing because the others were laughing
for a whole afternoon they had all been happy together as in his earlier childhood
he pushed the picture out of his mind
it was a false memory
he was troubled by false memories occasionally
they did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were
some things had happened others had not happened
he turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again
almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter
he had started as though a pin had run into him
a shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air
it was the bulletin !
victory !
it always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news
a sort of electric drill ran through the cafe
even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears
the trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise
already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside
the news had run round the streets like magic
he could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened as he had foreseen ; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy 's rear the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black
fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din : vast strategic manoeuvre - perfect co-ordination - utter rout - half a million prisoners - complete demoralization - control of the whole of africa - bring the war within measurable distance of its end victory - greatest victory in human history - victory victory victory !
under the table winston 's feet made convulsive movements
he had not stirred from his seat but in his mind he was running swiftly running he was with the crowds outside cheering himself deaf
he looked up again at the portrait of big brother
the colossus that bestrode the world !
the rock against which the hordes of asia dashed themselves in vain !
he thought how ten minutes ago - yes only ten minutes - there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat
ah it was more than a eurasian army that had perished !
much had changed in him since that first day in the ministry of love but the final indispensable healing change had never happened until this moment
the voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter but the shouting outside had died down a little
the waiters were turning back to their work
one of them approached with the gin bottle
winston sitting in a blissful dream paid no attention as his glass was filled up
he was not running or cheering any longer
he was back in the ministry of love with everything forgiven his soul white as snow
he was in the public dock confessing everything implicating everybody
he was walking down the white-tiled corridor with the feeling of walking in sunlight and an armed guard at his back
the longhoped-for bullet was entering his brain
he gazed up at the enormous face
forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache
o cruel needless misunderstanding !
o stubborn self-willed exile from the loving breast !
two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose
but it was all right everything was all right the struggle was finished
he had won the victory over himself
he loved big brother
newspeak was the official language of oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of ingsoc or english socialism
in the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used newspeak as his sole means of communication either in speech or writing
the leading articles in the times were written in it but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a specialist
it was expected that newspeak would have finally superseded oldspeak ( or standard english as we should call it ) by about the year 2050
meanwhile it gained ground steadily all party members tending to use newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech
the version in use in 1984 and embodied in the ninth and tenth editions of the newspeak dictionary was a provisional one and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later
it is with the final perfected version as embodied in the eleventh edition of the dictionary that we are concerned here
the purpose of newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of ingsoc but to make all other modes of thought impossible
it was intended that when newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgotten a heretical thought - that is a thought diverging from the principles of ingsoc - should be literally unthinkable at least so far as thought is dependent on words
its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member could properly wish to express while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods
this was done partly by the invention of new words but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever
to give a single example
the word free still existed in newspeak but it could only be used in such statements as this dog is free from lice or this field is free from weeds
it could not be used in its old sense of politically free or intellectually free since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts and were therefore of necessity nameless
quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to survive
newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum
newspeak was founded on the english language as we now know it though many newspeak sentences even when not containing newly-created words would be barely intelligible to an english-speaker of our own day
newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes known as the a vocabulary the b vocabulary ( also called compound words ) and the c vocabulary
it will be simpler to discuss each class separately but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the a vocabulary since the same rules held good for all three categories
the a vocabulary
the a vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday life - for such things as eating drinking working putting on one 's clothes going up and down stairs riding in vehicles gardening cooking and the like
it was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like hit run dog tree sugar house field - but in comparison with the present-day english vocabulary their number was extremely small while their meanings were far more rigidly defined
all ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of them
so far as it could be achieved a newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept
it would have been quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosophical discussion
it was intended only to express simple purposive thoughts usually involving concrete objects or physical actions
the grammar of newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities
the first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech
any word in the language ( in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as if or when ) could be used either as verb noun adjective or adverb
between the verb and the noun form when they were of the same root there was never any variation this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms
the word thought for example did not exist in newspeak
its place was taken by think which did duty for both noun and verb
no etymological principle was followed here : in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention in other cases the verb
even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected one or other of them was frequently suppressed
there was for example no such word as cut its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb knife
adjectives were formed by adding the suffix - ful to the noun-verb and adverbs by adding - wise
thus for example speedful meant rapid and speedwise meant quickly
certain of our present-day adjectives such as good strong big black soft were retained but their total number was very small
there was little need for them since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding - ful to a noun-verb
none of the now-existing adverbs was retained except for a very few already ending in - wise : the - wise termination was invariable
the word well for example was replaced by goodwise
in addition any word - this again applied in principle to every word in the language - could be negatived by adding the affix un - or could be strengthened by the affix plus - or for still greater emphasis doubleplus -
thus for example uncold meant warm while pluscold and doublepluscold meant respectively very cold and superlatively cold
it was also possible as in present-day english to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ante - post - up - down - etc
by such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary
given for instance the word good there was no need for such a word as bad since the required meaning was equally well - indeed better - expressed by ungood
all that was necessary in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites was to decide which of them to suppress
dark for example could be replaced by unlight or light by undark according to preference
the second distinguishing mark of newspeak grammar was its regularity
subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules
thus in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in - ed
the preterite of steal was stealed the preterite of think was thinked and so on throughout the language all such forms as swam gave brought spoke taken etc being abolished
all plurals were made by adding - s or - es as the case might be
the plurals of man ox life were mans oxes lifes
comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding - er - est ( good gooder goodest ) irregular forms and the more most formation being suppressed
the only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns the relatives the demonstrative adjectives and the auxiliary verbs
all of these followed their ancient usage except that whom had been scrapped as unnecessary and the shall should tenses had been dropped all their uses being covered by will and would
there were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech
a word which was difficult to utter or was liable to be incorrectly heard was held to be ipso_facto a bad word : occasionally therefore for the sake of euphony extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained
but this need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the b vocabulary
why so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay
the b vocabulary
the b vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes : words that is to say which not only had in every case a political implication but were intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them
without a full understanding of the principles of ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly
in some cases they could be translated into oldspeak or even into words taken from the a vocabulary but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones
the b words were a sort of verbal shorthand often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language
they consisted of two or more words or portions of words welded together in an easily pronounceable form
the resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb and inflected according to the ordinary rules
to take a single example : the word goodthink meaning very roughly orthodoxy or if one chose to regard it as a verb to think in an orthodox manner
this inflected as follows : noun-verb goodthink ; past tense and past participle goodthinked ; present participle good-thinking ; adjective goodthinkful ; adverb goodthinkwise ; verbal noun goodthinker
the b words were not constructed on any etymological plan
the words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation
in the word crimethink ( thoughtcrime ) for instance the think came second whereas in thinkpol ( thought police ) it came first and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable
because of the great difficulty in securing euphony irregular formations were commoner in the b vocabulary than in the a vocabulary
for example the adjective forms of minitrue minipax and miniluv were respectively minitruthful minipeaceful and minilovely simply because - trueful - paxful and - loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce
in principle however all b words could inflect and all inflected in exactly the same way
some of the b words had highly subtilized meanings barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole
consider for example such a typical sentence from a times leading article as oldthinkers unbellyfeel ingsoc
the shortest rendering that one could make of this in oldspeak would be : those whose ideas were formed before the revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of english socialism
but this is not an adequate translation
to begin with in order to grasp the full meaning of the newspeak sentence quoted above one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by ingsoc
and in addition only a person thoroughly grounded in ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word bellyfeel which implied a blind enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today ; or of the word oldthink which was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence
but the special function of certain newspeak words of which oldthink was one was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them
these words necessarily few in number had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term could now be scrapped and forgotten
the greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the newspeak dictionary was not to invent new words but having invented them to make sure what they meant : to make sure that is to say what ranges of words they cancelled by their existence
as we have already seen in the case of the word free words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them
countless other words such as honour justice morality internationalism democracy science an religion had simply ceased to exist
a few blanket words covered them and in covering them abolished them
all words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality for instance were contained in the single word crimethink while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink
greater precision would have been dangerous
what was required in a party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient hebrew who knew without knowing much else that all nations other than his own worshipped false gods
he did not need to know that these gods were called baal osiris moloch ashtaroth and the like : probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy
he knew jehovah and the commandments of jehovah : he knew therefore that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods
in somewhat the same way the party member knew what constituted right conduct and in exceedingly vague generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible
his sexual life for example was entirely regulated by the two newspeak words sexcrime ( sexual immorality ) and goodsex ( chastity ) 
sexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds whatever
it covered fornication adultery homosexuality and other perversions and in addition normal intercourse practised for its own sake
there was no need to enumerate them separately since they were all equally culpable and in principle all punishable by death
in the c vocabulary which consisted of scientific and technical words it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations but the ordinary citizen had no need of them
he knew what was meant by goodsex - that is to say normal intercourse between man and wife for the sole purpose of begetting children and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman : all else was sexcrime
in newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it was heretical : beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent
no word in the b vocabulary was ideologically neutral
a great many were euphemisms
such words for instance as joycamp ( forced-labour camp ) or minipax ministry of peace i _e ministry of war ) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean
some words on the other hand displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society
an example was prolefeed meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party handed out to the masses
other words again were ambivalent having the connotation good when applied to the party and bad when applied to its enemies
but in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning but from their structure
so far as it could be contrived everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary
the name of every organization or body of people or doctrine or country or institution or public building was invariably cut down into the familiar shape ; that is a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation
in the ministry of truth for example the records department in which winston smith worked was called recdep the fiction department was called ficdep the teleprogrammes department was called teledep and so on
this was not done solely with the object of saving time
even in the early decades of the twentieth century telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language ; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations
examples were such words as nazi gestapo comintern inprecorr agitprop
in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively but in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose
it was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it
the words communist international for instance call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood red flags barricades karl marx and the paris commune
the word comintern on the other hand suggests merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine
it refers to something almost as easily recognized and as limited in purpose as a chair or a table
comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought whereas communist international is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily
in the same way the associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and more controllable than those called up by ministry of truth
this accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable
in newspeak euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning
regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary
and rightly so since what was required above all for political purposes was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker 's mind
the words of the b vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike
almost invariably these words - goodthink minipax prolefeed sexcrime joycamp ingsoc bellyfeel thinkpol and countless others - were words of two or three syllables with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last
the use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech at once staccato and monotonous
and this was exactly what was aimed at
the intention was to make speech and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of consciousness
for the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary or sometimes necessary to reflect before speaking but a party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets
his training fitted him to do this the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument and the texture of the words with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of ingsoc assisted the process still further
so did the fact of having very few words to choose from
relative to our own the newspeak vocabulary was tiny and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised
newspeak indeed differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year
each reduction was a gain since the smaller the area of choice the smaller the temptation to take thought
ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all
this aim was frankly admitted in the newspeak word duckspeak meaning to quack like a duck
like various other words in the b vocabulary duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning
provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones it implied nothing but praise and when the times referred to one of the orators of the party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and valued compliment
the c vocabulary
the c vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms
these resembled the scientific terms in use today and were constructed from the same roots but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings
they followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies
very few of the c words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech
any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists
only a very few words were common to all lists and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of science as a habit of mind or a method of thought irrespective of its particular branches
there was indeed no word for science any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsoc
from the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions above a very low level was well-nigh impossible
it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind a species of blasphemy
it would have been possible for example to say big brother is ungood
but this statement which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity could not have been sustained by reasoned argument because the necessary words were not available
ideas inimical to ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so
one could in fact only use newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the words back into oldspeak
for example all mans are equal was a possible newspeak sentence but only in the same sense in which all men are redhaired is a possible oldspeak sentence
it did not contain a grammatical error but it expressed a palpable untruth - i e that all men are of equal size weight or strength
the concept of political equality no longer existed and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word equal
in 1984 when oldspeak was still the normal means of communication the danger theoretically existed that in using newspeak words one might remember their original meanings
in practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanished
a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of politically equal or that free had once meant intellectually free than for instance a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook
there would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable
and it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of newspeak would become more and more pronounced - its words growing fewer and fewer their meanings more and more rigid and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing
when oldspeak had been once and for all superseded the last link with the past would have been severed
history had already been rewritten but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there imperfectly censored and so long as one retained one 's knowledge of oldspeak it was possible to read them
in the future such fragments even if they chanced to survive would be unintelligible and untranslatable
it was impossible to translate any passage of oldspeak into newspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action or was already orthodox ( goodthinkful would be the newspeak expression ) in tendency
in practice this meant that no book written before approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole
pre-revolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translation - that is alteration in sense as well as language
take for example the well-known passage from the declaration of independence :
we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their powers from the consent of the governed
that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government .
it would have been quite impossible to render this into newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original
the nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink
a full translation could only be an ideological translation whereby jefferson 's words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government
a good deal of the literature of the past was indeed already being transformed in this way
considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figures while at the same time bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of ingsoc
various writers such as shakespeare milton swift byron dickens and some others were therefore in process of translation : when the task had been completed their original writings with all else that survived of the literature of the past would be destroyed
these translations were a slow and difficult business and it was not expected that they would be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first century
it was chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050
