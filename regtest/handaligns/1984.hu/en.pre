he be a bright cold day in april and the clock be striking thirteen
winston smith he chin nuzzle into he breast in an effort to escape the vile wind slip quickly through the glass door of victory mansion though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enter along with he
the hallway smelt of boil cabbage and old rag mat
at one end of he a colored poster too large for indoor display have be tack to the wall
he depict simply an enormous face more than a metre wide : the face of a man of about forty-five with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome feature
winston make for the stairs
he be no use trying the lift
even at the good of time he be seldom working and at present the electric current be cut off during daylight hours
he be part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week
the flat be seven flight up and winston who be thirty-nine and have a varicose ulcer above he right ankle go slowly resting several time on the way
on each landing opposite the lift-shaft the poster with the enormous face gaze from the wall
he be one of those picture which be so contrived that the eyes follow he about when he move
big brother be watch he the caption beneath he run
inside the flat a fruity voice be reading out a list of figure which have something to do with the production of pig-iron
the voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dull mirror which form part of the surface of the right-hand wall
winston turn a switch and the voice sink somewhat though the word be still distinguishable
the instrument ( the telescreen he be call ) could be dim but there be no way of shut he off completely
he move over to the window : a smallish frail figure the meagreness of he body merely emphasize by the blue overall which be the uniform of the party
he hair be very fair he face naturally sanguine he skin roughen by coarse soap and blunt razor blade and the cold of the winter that have just end
outside even through the shut window-pane the world look cold
down in the street little eddy of wind be whirl dust and tear paper into spiral and though the sun be shine and the sky a harsh blue there seem to be no colour in anything except the poster that be plastered everywhere
the blackmoustachio'd face gaze down from every commanding corner
there be one on the house-front immediately opposite
big brother be watch he the caption say while the dark eyes look deep into winston have own
down at streetlevel another poster tear at one corner flap fitfully in the wind alternately cover and uncover the single word ingsoc
in the far distance a helicopter skim down between the roof hover for an instant like a bluebottle and dart away again with a curve flight
he be the police patrol snoop into people have window
the patrol do not matter however
only the think police matter
behind winston have back the voice from the telescreen be still babble away about pig-iron and the overfulfillment of the ninth three-year plan
the telescreen receive and transmit simultaneously
any sound that winston make above the level of a very low whisper would be pick up by he moreover so long as he remain within the field of vision which the metal plaque command he could be see as well as hear
there be of course no way of knowing whether he be be watch at any give moment
how often or on what system the think police plug in on any individual wire be guess-work
he be even conceivable that he watch everybody all the time
but at any rate he could plug in he wire whenever he want to
he have to live - do live from habit that become instinct - in the assumption that every sound he make be overhear and except in darkness every movement scrutinize
winston keep he back turn to the telescreen
he be safe though as he well know even a back can be reveal
a kilometre away the ministry of truth he place of work towered vast and white above the grimy landscape
this he think with a sort of vague distaste - this be london chief city of airstrip one himself the third most populous of the province of oceania
he try to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell he whether london have always be quite like this
be there always these vista of rot nineteenth-century house he side shore up with balk of timber he window patch with cardboard and he roof with corrugate iron he crazy garden wall sag in all directions ?
and the bomb site where the plaster dust swirl in the air and the willow-herb straggle over the heap of rubble ; and the place where the bomb have clear a large patch and there have spring up sordid colony of wooden dwelling like chicken-house ?
but he be no use he could not remember : nothing remain of he childhood except a series of bright-light tableau occur against no background and mostly unintelligible
ministry of truth - minitrue in newspeak - be startlingly different from any other object in sight
he be an enormous pyramidal structure of glitter white concrete soar up terrace after terrace 300 metre into the air
from where winston stand he be just possible to read pick out on he white face in elegant lettering the three slogan of the party : war be peace freedom be slavery ignorance be strength
ministry of truth contain he be say three thousand room above ground level and correspond ramification below
scatter about london there be just three other building of similar appearance and size
so completely do he dwarf the surround architecture that from the roof of victory mansion he could see all four of them simultaneously
he be the home of the four ministry between which the entire apparatus of government be divided
the ministry of truth which concerned himself with news entertainment education and the fine arts
the ministry of peace which concerned himself with war
the ministry of love which maintain law and order
and the ministry of plenty which be responsible for economic affairs
he name in newspeak : minitrue minipax miniluv and miniplenty
the ministry of love be the really frighten one
there be no window in he at all
winston have never be inside the ministry of love nor within half a kilometre of he
he be a place impossible to enter except on official business and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglement steel door and hide machine-gun nest
even the street leading up to he outer barrier be roam by gorilla-face guard in black uniform armed with jointed truncheon
winston turn round abruptly
he have set he feature into the expression of quiet optimism which he be advisable to wear when facing the telescreen
he cross the room into the tiny kitchen
by leave the ministry at this time of day he have sacrifice he lunch in the canteen and he be aware that there be no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-colored bread which have get to be save for tomorrow have breakfast
he take down from the shelf a bottle of colorless liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin
he give off a sickly oily smell as of chinese rice spirit
winston pour out nearly a teacupful nerve himself for a shock and gulp he down like a dose of medicine
instantly he face turn scarlet and the water run out of he eyes
the stuff be like nitric acid and moreover in swallow he one have the sensation of be hit on the back of the head with a rubber club
the next moment however the burning in he belly die down and the world begin to look more cheerful
he take a cigarette from a crumple packet marked victory cigarette and incautiously hold he upright whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor
with the next he be more successful
he go back to the living-room and sit down at a small table that stand to the left of the telescreen
from the table drawer he take out a penholder a bottle of ink and a thick quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover
for some reason the telescreen in the living-room be in an unusual position
instead of be place as be normal in the end wall where he could command the whole room he be in the longer wall opposite the window
to one side of he there be a shallow alcove in which winston be now sitting and which when the flats be build have probably be intended to hold bookshelves
by sitting in the alcove and keeping well back winston be able to remain outside the range of the telescreen so far as sight go
he could be hear of course but so long as he stay in he present position he could not be see
he be partly the unusual geography of the room that have suggest to he the thing that he be now about to do
but he have also be suggest by the book that he have just take out of the drawer
he be a peculiarly beautiful book
he smooth creamy paper a little yellow by age be of a kind that have not be manufacture for at least forty year past
he could guess however that the book be much old than that
he have see he lie in the window of a frowzy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town ( just what quarter he do not now remember ) and have be strike immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess he
party member be supposed not to go into ordinary shop ( deal on the free market he be call ) but the rule be not strictly keep because there be various thing such as shoelace and razor blade which he be impossible to get hold of in any other way
he have give a quick glance up and down the street and then have slip inside and buy the book for two dollar fifty
at the time he be not conscious of wanting he for any particular purpose
he have carry he guiltily home in he briefcase
even with nothing write in he he be a compromise possession
the thing that he be about to do be to open a diary
this be not illegal ( nothing be illegal since there be no longer any law ) but if detect he be reasonably certain that he would be punish by death or at least by twenty-five year in a forced labor camp
winston fitted a nib into the penholder and suck he to get the grease off
the pen be an archaic instrument seldom used even for signature and he have procure one furtively and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserve to be write on with a real nib instead of be scratch with an ink-pencil
actually he be not used to writing by hand
apart from very short notes he be usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which be of course impossible for he present purpose
he dip the pen into the ink and then falter for just a second
a tremor have go through he bowel
to mark the paper be the decisive act
in small clumsy letters he write :
april 4th 1984
he sit back
a sense of complete helplessness have descend upon he
to begin with he do not know with any certainty that this be 1984
he musth be round about that date since he be fairly sure that he age be thirty-nine and he believe that he have be born in 1944 or 1945 ; but he be never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two
for who he suddenly occur to he to wonder be he writing this diary ?
for the future for the unborn
he mind hover for a moment round the doubtful date on the page and then fetch up with a bump against the newspeak word double-think
for the first time the magnitude of what he have undertake came home to he
how could he communicate with the future ?
he be of he nature impossible
either the future would resemble the present in which case he would not listen to he : or he would be different from he and he predicament would be meaningless
for some time he sit gaze stupidly at the paper
the telescreen have change over to strident military music
he be curious that he seem not merely to have lose the power of express himself but even to have forget what he be that he have originally intended to say
for week past he have be making ready for this moment and he have never cross he mind that anything would be need except courage
the actual writing would be easy
all he have to do be to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that have be running inside he head literally for year
at this moment however even the monologue have dry up
moreover he varicose ulcer have begin itch unbearably
he dare not scratch he because if he do so he always become inflame
the second be ticking by
he be conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of he the itch of the skin above he ankle the blare of the music and a slight booziness cause by the gin
suddenly he begin writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what he be setting down
he small but childish handwriting straggle up and down the page shed first he capital letters and finally even he full stops :
april 4th 1984
last night to the flick
all war film
one very good one of a ship full of refugee be bomb somewhere in the mediterranean
audience much amuse by shot of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after he first he saw he wallow along in the water like a porpoise then he saw he through the helicopter gunsights then he be full of hole and the sea round he turn pink and he sink as suddenly as though the hole have let in the water audience shout with laughter when he sink
then he saw a lifeboat full of child with a helicopter hover over he
there be a middle-aged woman might have be a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three year old in he arms
little boy scream with fright and hiding he head between he breast as if he be trying to burrow right into he and the woman putt he arms round he and comforting he although he be blue with fright himself all the time cover he up as much as possible as if he think he arms could keep the bullet off he
then the helicopter plant a 20 kilo bomb in amongst them terrific flash and the boat go all to matchwood
then there be a wonderful shot of a child have arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in he nose musth have follow he up and there be a lot of applause from the party seat but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly start kick up a fuss and shout he didnt oughter of show he not in front of kid he didnt he aint right not in front of kid he aint until the police turn he out i dont suppose anything happen to he nobody care what the prole say typical prole reaction he never -
winston stopped writing partly because he be suffering from cramp
he do not know what have make he pour out this stream of rubbish
but the curious thing be that while he be doing so a totally different memory have clarify himself in he mind to the point where he almost feel equal to writing he down
he be he now realize because of this other incident that he have suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today
he have happen that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous could be say to happen
he be nearly eleven hundred and in the record department where winston worked he be drag the chair out of the cubicle and grouping them in the center of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation for the two minutes hate
winston be just taking he place in one of the middle row when two people who he know by sight but have never speak to came unexpectedly into the room
one of them be a girl who he often pass in the corridor
he do not know he name but he know that he worked in the fiction department
presumably - since he have sometimes see he with oily hands and carry a spanner he have some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machine
he be a bold-look girl of about twenty-seven with thick hair a freckled face and swift athletic movement
a narrow scarlet sash emblem of the junior anti-sex league be wind several time round the waist of he overall just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of he hip
winston have dislike he from the very first moment of seeing he
he know the reason
he be because of the atmosphere of hockey-field and cold bath and community hike and general clean which he manage to carry about with he
he dislike nearly all woman and especially the young and pretty one
he be always the woman and above all the young one who be the most bigoted adherent of the party the swallower of slogan the amateur spy and nosers-out of unorthodoxy
but this particular girl give he the impression of be more dangerous than most
once when he pass in the corridor he give he a quick sidelong glance which seem to pierce right into he and for a moment have fill he with black terror
the idea have even cross he mind that he might be an agent of the think police
that he be true be very unlikely
still he continue to feel a peculiar uneasiness which have fear mixed up in he as well as hostility whenever he be anywhere near he
the other person be a man name o'brien a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote that winston have only a dim idea of he nature
a momentary hush pass over the group of people round the chair as he saw the black overall of an inner party member approach
o'brien be a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face
in spite of he formidable appearance he have a certain charm of manner
he have a trick of resettle he spectacles on he nose which be curiously disarming - in some indefinable way curiously civilized
he be a gesture which if anyone have still think in such terms might have recall an eighteenth-century nobleman offering he snuff-box
winston have see o'brien perhaps a dozen time in almost as many year
he feel deeply drawn to he and not solely because he be intrigue by the contrast between o'brien have urbane manner and he prise-fighter have physique
much more he be because of a secretly hold belief - or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope - that o'brien have political orthodoxy be not perfect
something in he face suggest he irresistibly
and again perhaps he be not even unorthodoxy that be write in he face but simply intelligence
but at any rate he have the appearance of be a person that he could talk to if somehow he could cheat the telescreen and get he alone
winston have never make the small effort to verify this guess : indeed there be no way of doing so
at this moment o'brien glance at he wrist-watch saw that he be nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay in the record department until the two minutes hate be over
he take a chair in the same row as winston a couple of place away
a small sandy woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston be between them
the girl with dark hair be sitting immediately behind
the next moment a hideous grind speech as of some monstrous machine running without oil burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room
he be a noise that set one have tooth on edge and bristle the hair at the back of one have neck
the hate have start
as usual the face of emmanuel goldstein the enemy of the people have flash on to the screen
there be hiss here and there amongst the audience
the little sandy woman give a squeak of mingle fear and disgust
goldstein be the renegade and backslider who once long ago ( how long ago nobody quite remember ) have be one of the leading figure of the party almost on a level with big brother himself and then have engaged in counter-revolutionary activity have be condemn to death and have mysteriously escape and disappear
the programme of the two minutes hate varied from day to day but there be none in which goldstein be not the principal figure
he be the primal traitor the earliest defiler of the party have purity
all subsequent crime against the party all treachery act of sabotage heresy deviation spring directly out of he teaching
somewhere or other he be still alive and hatch he conspiracy : perhaps somewhere beyond the sea under the protection of he foreign paymaster perhaps even - so he be occasionally rumour - in some hiding-place in oceania himself
winston have diaphragm be constrict
he could never see the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotion
he be a lean jewish face with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard - a clever face and yet somehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles be perch
he resemble the face of a sheep and the voice too have a sheep-like quality
goldstein be deliver he usual venomous attack upon the doctrine of the party - an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have be able to see through he and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarm feeling that other people less level-headed than oneself might be take in by he
he be abuse big brother he be denounce the dictatorship of the party he be demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia he be advocate freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of think he be crying hysterically that the revolution have be betray - and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which be a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orator of the party and even contain newspeak word : more newspeak word indeed than any party member would normally use in real life
and all the while lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which goldstein have specious claptrap cover behind he head on the telescreen there march the endless column of the eurasian army - row after row of solid-look man with expressionless asiatic face who swim up to the surface of the screen and vanish to be replace by other exactly similar
the dull rhythmical tramp of the soldier ' boots form the background to goldstein have bleat voice
before the hate have proceed for thirty second uncontrollable exclamation of rage be breaking out from half the people in the room
the self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen and the terrify power of the eurasian army behind he be too much to be bear : besides the sight or even the think of goldstein produce fear and anger automatically
he be an object of hatred more constant than either eurasia or eastasia since when oceania be at war with one of these power he be generally at peace with the other
but what be strange be that although goldstein be hate and despise by everybody although every day and a thousand time a day on platform on the telescreen in newspaper in book he theory be refute smashed ridicule hold up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that he be in spite of all this he influence never seem to grow less
always there be fresh dupe wait to be seduce by he
a day never pass when spy and saboteur acting under he directions be not unmask by the think police
he be the commander of a vast shadowy army an underground network of conspirator dedicated to the overthrow of the state
the brotherhood he name be supposed to be
there be also whisper storey of a terrible book a compendium of all the heresy of which goldstein be the author and which circulate clandestinely here and there
he be a book without a title
people refer to he if at all simply as the book
but one know of such thing only through vague rumour
neither the brotherhood nor the book be a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there be a way of avoid he
in he second minute the hate rose to a frenzy
people be leap up and down in he place and shout at the tops of he voice in an effort to drown the maddening bleat voice that came from the screen
the little sandy woman have turn bright pink and he mouth be opening and shut like that of a landed fish
even o'brien have heavy face be flush
he be sitting very straight in he chair he powerful chest swelling and quiver as though he be standing up to the assault of a wave
the dark girl behind winston have begin crying out swine ! swine ! swine ! and suddenly he pick up a heavy newspeak dictionary and fling he at the screen
he strike goldstein have nose and bounce off ; the voice continue inexorably
in a lucid moment winston found that he be shout with the other and kick he heel violently against the ring of he chair
the horrible thing about the two minutes hate be not that one be oblige to act a part but on the contrary that he be impossible to avoid join in
within thirty second any pretence be always unnecessary
a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash face in with a sledge-hammer seem to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current turning one even against one have will into a grimace scream lunatic
and yet the rage that one feel be an abstract undirected emotion which could be switch from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp
thus at one moment winston have hatred be not turn against goldstein at all but on the contrary against big brother the party and the think police ; and at such moment he heart go out to the lonely deride heretic on the screen sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lie
and yet the very next instant he be at one with the people about he and all that be say of goldstein seem to he to be true
at those moment he secret loathing of big brother change into adoration and big brother seem to tower up an invincible fearless protector standing like a rock against the horde of asia and goldstein in spite of he isolation he helplessness and the doubt that hang about he very existence seem like some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of he voice of wreck the structure of civilization
he be even possible at moment to switch one have hatred this way or that by a voluntary act
suddenly by the sort of violent effort with which one wrench one have head away from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeed in transfer he hatred from the face on the screen to the dark girl behind he
vivid beautiful hallucination flash through he mind
he would flog he to death with a rubber truncheon
he would tie he naked to a stake and shoot he full of arrows like saint sebastian
he would ravish he and cut he throat at the moment of climax
good than before moreover he realize why he be that he hate he
he hate he because he be young and pretty and sexless because he want to go to bed with he and would never do so because round he sweet supple waist which seem to ask he to encircle he with he arm there be only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity
the hate rose to he climax
the voice of goldstein have become an actual sheep have bleat and for an instant the face change into that of a sheep
then the sheep-face melt into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seem to be advance huge and terrible he sub-machine gun roaring and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen so that some of the people in the front row actually flinch backward in he seat
but in the same moment drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure melt into the face of big brother black blackmoustachio'd full of power and mysterious calm and so vast that he almost fill up the screen
nobody hear what big brother be saying
he be merely a few word of encouragement the sort of word that be utter in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restore confidence by the fact of be speak
then the face of big brother fade away again and instead the three slogan of the party stand out in bold capital : war be peace freedom be slavery ignorance be strength
but the face of big brother seem to persist for several second on the screen as though the impact that he have make on everyone have eyeball be too vivid to wear off immediately
the little sandyhaired woman have fling himself forward over the back of the chair in front of he
with a tremulous murmur that sound like he saviour ! he extended he arms towards the screen
then he bury he face in he hands
he be apparent that he be utter a prayer
at this moment the entire group of people break into a deep slow rhythmical chant of b-b ! . b-b ! . b-b ! - over and over again very slowly with a long pause between the first b and the second - a heavy murmurous sound somehow curiously savage in the background of which one seem to hear the stamp of naked foot and the throb of tom-tom
for perhaps as much as thirty second he keep he up
he be a refrain that be often hear in moment of overwhelming emotion
partly he be a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother but still more he be an act of self-hypnosis a deliberate drown of consciousness by means of rhythmical noise
winston have entrails seem to grow cold
in the two minutes hate he could not help share in the general delirium but this sub-human chant of b-b ! . b-b ! always fill he with horror
of course he chant with the rest : he be impossible to do otherwise
to dissemble he feeling to control he face to do what everyone else be doing be an instinctive reaction
but there be a space of a couple of second during which the expression of he eyes might conceivably have betray he
and he be exactly at this moment that the significant thing happen - if indeed he do happen
momentarily he catch o'brien have eye
o'brien have stand up
he have take off he spectacles and be in the act of resettle them on he nose with he characteristic gesture
but there be a fraction of a second when he eyes meet and for as long as he take to happen winston know - yes he know ! - that o'brien be thinking the same thing as himself
an unmistakable message have pass
he be as though he two mind have open and the thought be flow from one into the other through he eyes
i be with he o'brien seem to be saying to he
i know precisely what he be feeling
i know all about he contempt he hatred he disgust
but do worry i be on he side !
and then the flash of intelligence be go and o'brien have face be as inscrutable as everybody else have
that be all and he be already uncertain whether he have happen
such incident never have any sequel
all that he do be to keep alive in he the belief or hope that other besides himself be the enemy of the party
perhaps the rumour of vast underground conspiracy be true after all - perhaps the brotherhood really exist !
he be impossible in spite of the endless arrest and confession and execution to be sure that the brotherhood be not simply a myth
some days he believe in he some days not
there be no evidence only fleeting glimpse that might mean anything or nothing : snatch of overhear conversation faint scribble on lavatory wall - once even when two stranger meet a small movement of the hand which have look as though he might be a signal of recognition
he be all guess-work : very likely he have imagine everything
he have go back to he cubicle without look at o'brien again
the idea of following up he momentary contact hardly cross he mind
he would have be inconceivably dangerous even if he have known how to set about doing he
for a second two second he have exchange an equivocal glance and that be the end of the storey
but even that be a memorable event in the lock loneliness in which one have to live
winston rouse himself and sit up straight
he let out a belch
the gin be rising from he stomach
he eyes re-focus on the page
he discover that while he sit helplessly muse he have also be writing as though by automatic action
and he be no longer the same cramped awkward handwriting as before
he pen have slide voluptuously over the smooth paper printing in large neat capital down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again filling half a page
he could not help feeling a twinge of panic
he be absurd since the writing of those particular word be not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary but for a moment he be tempt to tear out the spoil page and abandon the enterprise altogether
he do not do so however because he know that he be useless
whether he write down with big brother or whether he refrain from writing he make no difference
whether he go on with the diary or whether he do not go on with he make no difference
the think police would get he just the same
he have commit - would still have commit even if he have never set pen to paper - the essential crime that contain all other in himself
thoughtcrime he call he
thoughtcrime be not a thing that could be conceal for ever
he might dodge successfully for a while even for year but sooner or later he be bound to get he
he be always at night - the arrest invariably happen at night
the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shake he shoulder the lights glaring in he eyes the ring of hard face round the bed
in the vast majority of case there be no trial no report of the arrest
people simply disappear always during the night
he name be removed from the register every record of everything he have ever done be wipe out he one-time existence be deny and then forget
he be abolish annihilate : vaporize be the usual word
for a moment he be seize by a kind of hysteria
he begin writing in a hurried untidy scrawl :
theyll shoot he i do care theyll shoot he in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother he always shoot he in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother
he sit back in he chair slightly ashamed of himself and lay down the pen
the next moment he start violently
there be a knock at the door
already !
he sit as still as a mouse in the futile hope that whoever he be might go away after a single attempt
but no the knock be repeated
the bad thing of all would be to delay
he heart be thumping like a drum but he face from long habit be probably expressionless
he get up and move heavily towards the door
as he put he hand to the door-knob winston saw that he have left the diary open on the table
down with big brother be write all over he in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room
he be an inconceivably stupid thing to have done
but he realize even in he panic he have not want to smudge the creamy paper by shut the book while the ink be wet
he draw in he breath and open the door
instantly a warm wave of relief flow through he
a colorless crush-look woman with wispy hair and a line face be standing outside
oh comrade he begin in a dreary whine sort of voice i think i hear he come in
do he think he could come across and have a look at he kitchen sink ?
he have get blocked up and -
he be mrs parson the wife of a neighbour on the same floor
 ( mrs be a word somewhat discountenance by the party - he be supposed to call everyone comrade - but with some woman one used he instinctively ) 
he be a woman of about thirty but look much old
one have the impression that there be dust in the crease of he face
winston follow he down the passage
these amateur repair job be an almost daily irritation
victory mansion be old flats build in 1930 or thereabout and be fall to piece
the plaster flake constantly from ceiling and wall the pipe burst in every hard frost the roof leak whenever there be snow the heat system be usually running at half steam when he be not closed down altogether from motive of economy
repair except what he could do for himself have to be sanction by remote committee which be liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two year
of course he have only because tom be home say mrs parson vaguely
the parson ' flat be big than winston have and dingy in a different way
everything have a batter trample-on look as though the place have just be visit by some large violent animal
game impedimenta - hockey-stick boxing-glove a burst football a pair of sweaty shorts turn inside out - lay all over the floor and on the table there be a litter of dirty dish and dog-eared exercise-book
on the wall be scarlet banner of the youth league and the spy and a full-sized poster of big brother
there be the usual boil-cabbage smell common to the whole building but he be shot through by a sharper reek of sweat which - one know this at the first sniff though he be hard to say how be the sweat of some person not present at the moment
in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper be trying to keep tune with the military music which be still issue from the telescreen
he have the child say mrs parson casting a half-apprehensive glance at the door
he have be out today
and of course -
he have a habit of breaking off he sentence in the middle
the kitchen sink be full nearly to the bream with filthy greenish water which smelt bad than ever of cabbage
winston kneel down and examine the angle-joint of the pipe
he hate use he hands and he hate bend down which be always liable to start he cough
mrs parson look on helplessly
of course if tom be home he have put he right in a moment he say
he love anything like that
he have ever so good with he hands tom be
parson be winston have fellow-employee at the ministry of truth
he be a fattish but active man of paralyse stupidity a mass of imbecile enthusiasm - one of those completely unquestioning devoted drudge on who more even than on the think police the stability of the party depend
at thirty-five he have just be unwillingly evict from the youth league and before graduate into the youth league he have manage to stay on in the spy for a year beyond the statutory age
at the ministry he be employ in some subordinate post for which intelligence be not require but on the other hand he be a leading figure on the sports committee and all the other committee engaged in organize community hike spontaneous demonstration saving campaign and voluntary activity generally
he would inform he with quiet pride between whiff of he pipe that he have put in an appearance at the community center every evening for the past four year
an overpowering smell of sweat a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuosity of he life follow he about wherever he go and even remain behind he after he have go
have he get a spanner ?
say winston fiddling with the nut on the angle-joint
a spanner say mrs parson immediately becoming invertebrate
i do know i be sure
perhaps the child -
there be a trample of boots and another blast on the comb as the child charge into the living-room
mrs parson bring the spanner
winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that have blocked up the pipe
he clean he finger as good he could in the cold water from the tap and go back into the other room
up with he hands ! yell a savage voice
a handsome tough-look boy of nine have pop up from behind the table and be menace he with a toy automatic pistol while he small sister about two year young make the same gesture with a fragment of wood
both of them be dress in the blue shorts grey shirt and red neckerchief which be the uniform of the spy
winston raise he hands above he head but with an uneasy feeling so vicious be the boy have demeanour that he be not altogether a game
he be a traitor ! yell the boy
he be a think-criminal !
he be a eurasian spy !
i will shoot he i will vaporize he i will scend he to the salt mine !
suddenly he be both leap round he shout traitor ! and think-criminal ! the little girl imitate he brother in every movement
he be somehow slightly frighten like the gambol of tiger cub which will soon grow up into man-eater
there be a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy have eye a quite evident desire to hit or kick winston and a consciousness of be very nearly big enough to do so
he be a good job he be not a real pistol he be holding winston think
mrs parson ' eyes flit nervously from winston to the child and back again
in the good light of the living-room he notice with interest that there actually be dust in the crease of he face
he do get so noisy he say
he be disappointed because he could go to see the hanging that have what he be
i be too busy to take them and tom will be back from work in time
why can he go and see the hanging ?
roar the boy in he huge voice
want to see the hanging !
want to see the hanging ! chant the little girl still caper round
some eurasian prisoner guilty of war crime be to be hang in the park that evening winston remember
this happen about once a month and be a popular spectacle
child always clamour to be take to see he
he take he leave of mrs parson and make for the door
but he have not go six step down the passage when something hit the back of he neck an agonizingly painful blow
he be as though a red-hot wire have be jab into he
he spun round just in time to see mrs parson drag he son back into the doorway while the boy pocket a catapult
goldstein ! bellow the boy as the door closed on he
but what most strike winston be the look of helpless fright on the woman have greyish face
back in the flat he step quickly past the telescreen and sit down at the table again still rubbing he neck
the music from the telescreen have stopped
instead a clip military voice be reading out with a sort of brutal relish a description of the armament of the new floating fortress which have just be anchor between iceland and the faroe island
with those child he think that wretched woman musth lead a life of terror
another year two year and he would be watch he night and day for symptom of unorthodoxy
nearly all child nowadays be horrible
what be bad of all be that by means of such organization as the spy he be systematically turn into ungovernable little savage and yet this produce in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the party
on the contrary he adore the party and everything connected with he
the song the procession the banner the hike the drill with dummy rifle the yell of slogan the worship of big brother - he be all a sort of glorious game to them
all he ferocity be turn outward against the enemy of the state against foreigner traitor saboteur think-criminal
he be almost normal for people over thirty to be frighten of he own child
and with good reason for hardly a week pass in which the time do not carry a paragraph describe how some eavesdrop little sneak - child hero be the phrase generally used - have overhear some compromise remarque and denounce he parent to the think police
the sting of the catapult bullet have wear off
he pick up he pen half-heartedly wonder whether he could find something more to write in the diary
suddenly he begin thinking of o'brien again
year ago - how long be he ?
seven year he musth be - he have dream that he be walking through a pitch-dark room
and someone sitting to one side of he have say as he pass : he shall meet in the place where there be no darkness
he be say very quietly almost casually - a statement not a command
he have walk on without pause
what be curious be that at the time in the dream the word have not make much impression on he
he be only later and by degree that he have seem to take on significance
he could not now remember whether he be before or after have the dream that he have see o'brien for the first time nor could he remember when he have first identify the voice as o'brien have
but at any rate the identification exist
he be o'brien who have speak to he out of the dark
winston have never be able to feel sure - even after this morning have flash of the eyes he be still impossible to be sure whether o'brien be a friend or an enemy
nor do he even seem to matter greatly
there be a link of understanding between them more important than affection or partisanship
he shall meet in the place where there be no darkness he have say
winston do not know what he mean only that in some way or another he would come true
the voice from the telescreen pause
a trumpet call clear and beautiful float into the stagnant air
the voice continue raspingly :
attention !
he attention please !
a newsflash have this moment arrive from the malabar front
he force in south india have win a glorious victory
i be authorize to say that the action he be now report may well bring the war within measurable distance of he end
here be the newsflash -
bad news coming think winston
and sure enough following on a gory description of the annihilation of a eurasian army with stupendous figure of kill and prisoner came the announcement that as from next week the chocolate ration would be reduce from thirty gram to twenty
winston belch again
the gin be wearing off leave a deflate feeling
the telescreen - perhaps to celebrate the victory perhaps to drown the memory of the lose chocolate - crash into oceania 't be for thee
he be supposed to stand to attention
however in he present position he be invisible
oceania 't be for thee give way to lighter music
winston walk over to the window keeping he back to the telescreen
the day be still cold and clear
somewhere far away a rocket bomb explode with a dull reverberate roar
about twenty or thirty of them a week be fall on london at present
down in the street the wind flap the tear poster to and fro and the word ingsoc fitfully appear and vanish
ingsoc
the sacred principle of ingsoc
newspeak double-think the mutability of the past
he feel as though he be wandering in the forest of the sea bottom lose in a monstrous world where he himself be the monster
he be alone
the past be dead the future be unimaginable
what certainty have he that a single human creature now living be on he side ?
and what way of knowing that the dominium of the party would not endure for ever ?
like an answer the three slogan on the white face of the ministry of truth came back to he : war be peace freedom be slavery ignorance be strength he take a twenty-five cent piece out of he pocket
there too in tiny clear lettering the same slogan be inscribe and on the other face of the coin the head of big brother
even from the coin the eyes pursue he
on coin on stamp on the cover of book on banner on poster and on the wrapping of a cigarette packet - everywhere
always the eyes watch he and the voice envelop he
asleep or awake working or eating indoors or out of door in the bath or in bed - no escape
nothing be he own except the few cubic centimetre inside he skull
the sun have shift round and the myriad window of the ministry of truth with the light no longer shine on them look grim as the loophole of a fortress
he heart quail before the enormous pyramidal shape
he be too strong he could not be storm
a thousand rocket bomb would not batter he down
he wonder again for who he be writing the diary
for the future for the past - for an age that might be imaginary
and in front of he there lay not death but annihilation
the diary would be reduce to ashes and himself to vapour
only the think police would read what he have write before he wipe he out of existence and out of memory
how could he make appeal to the future when not a trace of he not even an anonymous word scribble on a piece of paper could physically survive ?
the telescreen strike fourteen
he musth leave in ten minutes
he have to be back at work by fourteen-thirty
curiously the chime of the hour seem to have put new heart into he
he be a lonely ghost utter a truth that nobody would ever hear
but so long as he utter he in some obscure way the continuity be not break
he be not by making himself hear but by stay sane that he carry on the human heritage
he go back to the table dip he pen and write :
to the future or to the past to a time when think be free when man be different from one another and do not live alone - to a time when truth exist and what be done can be undone :
from the age of uniformity from the age of solitude from the age of big brother from the age of double-think - greeting !
he be already dead he reflect
he seem to he that he be only now when he have begin to be able to formulate he thought that he have take the decisive step
the consequences of every act be included in the act himself
he write :
thoughtcrime do not entail death : thoughtcrime be death
now he have recognize himself as a dead man he become important to stay alive as long as possible
two finger of he right hand be inkstained
he be exactly the kind of detail that might betray he
some nosing zealot in the ministry ( a woman probably : someone like the little sandy woman or the dark girl from the fiction department ) might start wonder why he have be writing during the lunch interval why he have used an old-fashioned pen what he have be writing - and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter
he go to the bathroom and carefully scrub the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasp he skin like sandpaper and be therefore well adapt for this purpose
he put the diary away in the drawer
he be quite useless to think of hiding he but he could at least make sure whether or not he existence have be discover
a hair lay across the page-end be too obvious
with the tip of he finger he pick up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposit he on the corner of the cover where he be bound to be shake off if the book be move
winston be dream of he mother
he musth he think have be ten or eleven year old when he mother have disappear
he be a tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow movement and magnificent fair hair
he father he remember more vaguely as dark and thin dress always in neat dark clothes ( winston remember especially the very thin sole of he father have shoe ) and wearing spectacles
the two of them musth evidently have be swallow up in one of the first great purge of the fifty
at this moment he mother be sitting in some place deep down beneath he with he young sister in he arms
he do not remember he sister at all except as a tiny feeble baby always silent with large watchful eyes
both of them be look up at he
he be down in some subterranean place - the bottom of a well for instance or a very deep grave - but he be a place which already far below he be himself moving downward
he be in the saloon of a sinking ship look up at he through the darken water
there be still air in the saloon he could still see he and he them but all the while he be sinking down down into the green water which in another moment musth hide them from sight for ever
he be out in the light and air while he be be suck down to death and he be down there because he be up here
he know he and he know he and he could see the knowledge in he face
there be no reproach either in he face or in he hearts only the knowledge that he musth die in order that he might remain alive and that this be part of the unavoidable order of thing
he could not remember what have happen but he know in he dream that in some way the live of he mother and he sister have be sacrifice to he own
he be one of those dream which while retain the characteristic dream scenery be a continuation of one have intellectual life and in which one become aware of facts and idea which still seem new and valuable after one be awake
the thing that now suddenly strike winston be that he mother have death nearly thirty year ago have be tragic and sorrowful in a way that be no longer possible
tragedy he perceive belong to the ancient time to a time when there be still privacy love and friendship and when the member of a family stand by one another without need to know the reason
he mother have memory tear at he heart because he have die loving he when he be too young and selfish to love he in return and because somehow he do not remember how he have sacrifice himself to a conception of loyalty that be private and unalterable
such thing he saw could not happen today
today there be fear hatred and pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complex sorrow
all this he seem to see in the large eyes of he mother and he sister look up at he through the green water hundred of fathom down and still sinking
suddenly he be standing on short springy turf on a summer evening when the slanting ray of the sun gild the ground
the landscape that he be look at recur so often in he dream that he be never fully certain whether or not he have see he in the real world
in he wake thought he call he the golden country
he be an old rabbit-bite pasture with a foot-track wandering across he and a mole-hill here and there
in the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the bough of the elm tree be sway very faintly in the breeze he leave just stirring in dense masses like woman have hair
somewhere near at hand though out of sight there be a clear slow-moving stream where dace be swim in the pools under the willow tree
the girl with dark hair be coming towards them across the field
with what seem a single movement he tear off he clothes and fling them disdainfully aside
he body be white and smooth but he arouse no desire in he indeed he barely look at he
what overwhelm he in that instant be admiration for the gesture with which he have throw he clothes aside
with he grace and carelessness he seem to annihilate a whole culture a whole system of think as though big brother and the party and the think police could all be sweep into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm
that too be a gesture belonging to the ancient time
winston wake up with the word shakespeare on he lip
the telescreen be give forth an ear-splitting whistle which continue on the same note for thirty second
he be nought seven fifteen get-up time for office worker
winston wrench he body out of bed - naked for a member of the outer party receive only 3 000 clothing coupon annually and a suit of pyjamas be 600 - and seize a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that be lie across a chair
the physical jerk would begin in three minutes
the next moment he be double up by a violent cough fit which nearly always attack he soon after wake up
he empty he lung so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lie on he back and taking a series of deep gasp
he vein have swell with the effort of the cough and the varicose ulcer have start itch
thirty to forty group ! yap a piercing female voice
thirty to forty group !
take he place please
thirty to forty !
winston spring to attention in front of the telescreen upon which the image of a youngish woman scrawny but muscular dress in tunic and gym-shoe have already appear
arms bend and stretch ! he rap out
take he time by he
one two three four !
one two three four !
come on comrade put a bit of life into he !
one two three four !
one two three four ! .
the pain of the cough fit have not quite drive out of winston have mind the impression make by he dream and the rhythmical movement of the exercise restore he somewhat
as he mechanically shot he arms back and forth wearing on he face the look of grim enjoyment which be considered proper during the physical jerk he be struggle to think he way backward into the dim period of he early childhood
he be extraordinarily difficult
beyond the late fifty everything fade
when there be no external record that he could refer to even the outline of he own life lose he sharpness
he remember huge event which have quite probably not happen he remember the detail of incident without be able to recapture he atmosphere and there be long blank period to which he could assign nothing
everything have be different then
even the name of country and he shape on the map have be different
airstrip one for instance have not be so call in those days : he have be call england or britain though london he feel fairly certain have always be call london
winston could not definitely remember a time when he country have not be at war but he be evident that there have be a fairly long interval of peace during he childhood because one of he early memory be of an air raid which appear to take everyone by surprise
perhaps he be the time when the atomic bomb have fall on colchester
he do not remember the raid himself but he do remember he father have hand clutch he own as he hurried down down down into some place deep in the earth round and round a spiral staircase which ring under he foot and which finally so weary he leg that he begin whimpering and he have to stop and rest
he mother in he slow dreamy way be following a long way behind them
he be carry he baby sister - or perhaps he be only a bundle of blanket that he be carry : he be not certain whether he sister have be born then
finally he have emerge into a noisy crowded place which he have realize to be a tube station
there be people sitting all over the stone-flag floor and other people pack tightly together be sitting on metal bunk one above the other
winston and he mother and father found himself a place on the floor and near them an old man and an old woman be sitting side by side on a bunk
the old man have on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair : he face be scarlet and he eyes be blue and full of tears
he reek of gin
he seem to breathe out of he skin in place of sweat and one could have fancied that the tears well from he eyes be pure gin
but though slightly drunk he be also suffering under some grief that be genuine and unbearable
in he childish way winston grasp that some terrible thing something that be beyond forgiveness and could never be remedy have just happen
he also seem to he that he know what he be
someone who the old man love - a little granddaughter perhaps have be kill
every few minutes the old man keep repeat :
he do aught to 'ave trust 'em
i say so ma do i ?
that have what come of trustful 'em
i say so all along
he do aught to 'ave trust the bugger
but which bugger he do aught to have trust winston could not now remember
since about that time war have be literally continuous though strictly speaking he have not always be the same war
for several month during he childhood there have be confuse street fight in london himself some of which he remember vividly
but to trace out the history of the whole period to say who be fight who at any give moment would have be utterly impossible since no write record and no speak word ever make mention of any other alignment than the exist one
at this moment for example in 1984 ( if he be 1984 ) oceania be at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia
in no public or private utterance be he ever admit that the three power have at any time be group along different lines
actually as winston well know he be only four year since oceania have be at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia
but that be merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happen to possess because he memory be not satisfactorily under control
officially the change of partners have never happen
oceania be at war with eurasia : therefore oceania have always be at war with eurasia
the enemy of the moment always re-present absolute evil and he follow that any past or future agreement with he be impossible
the frighten thing he reflect for the ten thousandth time as he forced he shoulder painfully backward ( with hands on hip he be gyrate he body from the waist an exercise that be supposed to be good for the back muscle ) - the frighten thing be that he might all be true
if the party could thrust he hand into the past and say of this or that event he never happen - that surely be more terrify than mere torture and death ?
the party say that oceania have never be in alliance with eurasia
he winston smith know that oceania have be in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four year ago
but where do that knowledge exist ?
only in he own consciousness which in any case musth soon be annihilate
and if all other accepted the lie which the party impose - if all record tell the same tale - then the lie pass into history and become truth
who control the past run the party slogan control the future : who control the present control the past
and yet the past though of he nature alterable never have be alter
whatever be true now be true from everlasting to everlasting
he be quite simple
all that be need be an unending series of victory over he own memory
reality control he call he : in newspeak double-think
stand easy ! bark the instructress a little more genially
winston sink he arms to he side and slowly refill he lung with air
he mind slide away into the labyrinthine world of double-think
to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully construct lie to hold simultaneously two opinion which cancel out knowing them to be contradictory and believe in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while lay claim to he to believe that democracy be impossible and that the party be the guardian of democracy to forget whatever he be necessary to forget then to draw he back into memory again at the moment when he be need and then promptly to forget he again : and above all to apply the same process to the process himself
that be the ultimate subtlety : consciously to induce unconsciousness and then once again to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis he have just perform
even to understand the word double-think involved the use of double-think
the instructress have call them to attention again
and now let have see which of he can touch he toe ! he say enthusiastically
right over from the hip please comrade
one-two !
one-two ! .
winston loathe this exercise which send shoot pains all the way from he heel to he buttock and often end by bring on another cough fit
the half-pleasant quality go out of he meditation
the past he reflect have not merely be alter he have be actually destroy
for how could he establish even the most obvious fact when there exist no record outside he own memory ?
he try to remember in what year he have first hear mention of big brother
he think he musth have be at some time in the sixty but he be impossible to be certain
in the party history of course big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the revolution since he very earliest days
he exploit have be gradually pushed backward in time until already he extended into the fabulous world of the forty and the thirty when the capitalist in he strange cylindrical hat still ride through the street of london in great gleam motor-car or horse carriage with glass side
there be no knowing how much of this legend be true and how much invent
winston could not even remember at what date the party himself have come into existence
he do not believe he have ever hear the word ingsoc before 1960 but he be possible that in he oldspeak forme - english socialism that be to say - he have be current earlier
everything melt into mist
sometimes indeed he could put he finger on a definite lie
he be not true for example as be claim in the party history book that the party have invent aeroplane
he remember aeroplane since he earliest childhood
but he could prove nothing
there be never any evidence
just once in he whole life he have hold in he hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact
and on that occasion -
smith ! scream the shrewish voice from the telescreen 6079 smith w !
yes he !
bend lower please !
he can do good than that
he be not trying
lower please !
that have good comrade
now stand at ease the whole squad and watch he
a sudden hot sweat have break out all over winston have body
he face remain completely inscrutable
never show dismay !
never show resentment !
a single flicker of the eyes could give he away
he stand watch while the instructress raise he arms above he head and - one could not say gracefully but with remarkable neatness and efficiency - bent over and tuck the first joint of he finger under he toe
there comrade !
that have how i want to see he doing he
watch he again
i be thirty-nine and i have have four child
now look
he bent over again
he see he knee be bent
he can all do he if he want to he add as he straighten himself up
anyone under forty-five be perfectly capable of touching he toe
he do all have the privilege of fight in the front line but at least he can all keep fit
remember he boy on the malabar front !
and the sailor in the floating fortress !
just think what he have to put up with
now try again
that have good comrade that have much good he add encouragingly as winston with a violent lunge succeed in touching he toe with knee unbend for the first time in several year
with the deep unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent he from utter when he day have work start winston pull the speakwrite towards he blow the dust from he mouthpiece and put on he spectacles
then he unroll and clip together four small cylinder of paper which have already flop out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of he desk
in the wall of the cubicle there be three orifice
to the right of the speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for write message to the left a large one for newspaper ; and in the side wall within easy reach of winston have arm a large oblong slit protect by a wire grating
this last be for the disposal of waste paper
similar slit exist in thousand or ten of thousand throughout the building not only in every room but at short interval in every corridor
for some reason he be nickname memory hole
when one know that any document be due for destruction or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lie about he be an automatic action to lift the flap of the near memory hole and drop he in whereupon he would be whirl away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnace which be hide somewhere in the recess of the building
winston examine the four slip of paper which he have unroll
each contain a message of only one or two lines in the abbreviate jargon - not actually newspeak but consist largely of newspeak word - which be used in the ministry for internal purpose
he run :
time 17 3 84 bb speech malreported africa rectify
time 19 12 83 forecast 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprint verify current issue
time 14 2 84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify
time 3 12 83 report bb dayorder dubleplusungood ref unperson rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
with a faint feeling of satisfaction winston lay the fourth message aside
he be an intricate and responsible job and have good be deal with last
the other three be routine matter though the second one would probably mean some tedious wade through lists of figure
winston dialled back number on the telescreen and call for the appropriate issue of the time which slide out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes ' delay
the message he have receive refer to article or news item which for one reason or another he be think necessary to alter or as the official phrase have he to rectify
for example he appear from the time of the seventeenth of march that big brother in he speech of the previous day have predict that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly be launch in north africa
as he happen the eurasian high command have launch he offensive in south india and left north africa alone
he be therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brother have speech in such a way as to make he predict the thing that have actually happen
or again the time of the nineteenth of december have publish the official forecast of the output of various classis of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983 which be also the sixth quarter of the ninth three-year plan
today have issue contain a statement of the actual output from which he appear that the forecast be in every instance grossly wrong
winston have job be to rectify the original figure by making them agree with the later one
as for the third message he refer to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes
as short a time ago as february the ministry of plenty have issue a promise ( a categorical pledge be the official word ) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984
actually as winston be aware the chocolate ration be to be reduce from thirty gram to twenty at the end of the present week
all that be need be to substitute for the original promise a warning that he would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april
as soon as winston have deal with each of the message he clip he speakwritten correction to the appropriate copy of the time and pushed them into the pneumatic tube
then with a movement which be as nearly as possible unconscious he crumple up the original message and any notes that he himself have make and drop them into the memory hole to be devour by the flame
what happen in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tube lead he do not know in detail but he do know in general terms
as soon as all the correction which happen to be necessary in any particular number of the time have be assemble and collate that number would be reprint the original copy destroy and the correct copy place on the file in he stead
this process of continuous alteration be applied not only to newspaper but to book periodical pamphlet poster leaflet film sound-track cartoon photograph - to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance
day by day and almost minute by minute the past be bring up to date
in this way every prediction make by the party could be show by documentary evidence to have be correct nor be any item of news or any expression of opinion which conflict with the needs of the moment ever allow to remain on record
all history be a palimpsest scrape clean and reinscribed exactly as often as be necessary
in no case would he have be possible once the deed be done to prove that any falsification have take place
the large section of the record department far large than the one on which winston worked consist simply of person who duty he be to track down and collect all copy of book newspaper and other document which have be supersede and be due for destruction
a number of the time which might because of change in political alignment or mistake prophecy utter by big brother have be rewrite a dozen time still stand on the file bearing he original date and no other copy exist to contradict he
book also be recall and rewrite again and again and be invariably reissue without any admission that any alteration have be make
even the write instructions which winston receive and which he invariably get rid of as soon as he have deal with them never stated or implied that an act of forgery be to be commit : always the reference be to slip error misprint or misquotation which he be necessary to put right in the interest of accuracy
but actually he think as he re-adjust the ministry of plenty have figure he be not even forgery
he be merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another
most of the material that he be deal with have no connection with anything in the real world not even the kind of connection that be contain in a direct lie
statistics be just as much a fantasy in he original version as in he rectify version
a great deal of the time he be expect to make them up out of he head
for example the ministry of plenty have forecast have estimate the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs
the actual output be give as sixty-two million
winston however in rewrite the forecast marked the figure down to fifty-seven million so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota have be overfulfilled
in any case sixty-two million be no near the truth than fiftyseven million or than 145 million
very likely no boots have be produce at all
likely still nobody know how many have be produce much less care
all one know be that every quarter astronomical number of boots be produce on paper while perhaps half the population of oceania go barefooted
and so he be with every class of record fact great or small
everything fade away into a shadow-world in which finally even the date of the year have become uncertain
winston glance across the hall
in the correspond cubicle on the other side a small precise-look dark-chin man name tillotson be working steadily away with a fold newspaper on he knee and he mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite
he have the air of trying to keep what he be saying a secret between himself and the telescreen
he look up and he spectacles dart a hostile flash in winston have direction
winston hardly know tillotson and have no idea what work he be employ on
people in the record department do not readily talk about he job
in the long windowless hall with he double row of cubicle and he endless rustle of paper and hum of voice murmur into speakwrites there be quite a dozen people who winston do not even know by name though he daily saw them hurry to and fro in the corridor or gesticulate in the two minutes hate
he know that in the cubicle next to he the little woman with sandy hair toil day in day out simply at track down and delete from the press the name of people who have be vaporize and be therefore considered never to have exist
there be a certain fitness in this since he own husband have be vaporize a couple of year earlier
and a few cubicle away a mild ineffectual dreamy creature name ampleforth with very hairy ear and a surprising talent for juggle with rhyme and metre be engaged in produce garble version - definitive text he be call - of poem which have become ideologically offensive but which for one reason or another be to be retain in the anthology
and this hall with he fifty worker or thereabout be only one sub-section a single cell as he be in the huge complexity of the record department
beyond above below be other swarm of worker engaged in an unimaginable multitude of job
there be the huge printingshops with he sub-editor he typography expert and he elaborately equip studio for the fake of photograph
there be the tele-programme section with he engineer he producer and he team of actor specially choose for he skill in imitate voice
there be the army of reference clerk who job be simply to draw up lists of book and periodical which be due for recall
there be the vast repository where the correct document be store and the hide furnace where the original copy be destroy
and somewhere or other quite anonymous there be the direct brain who coordinate the whole effort and lay down the lines of policy which make he necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserve that one falsify and the other rub out of existence
and the record department after all be himself only a single branch of the ministry of truth who primary job be not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizen of oceania with newspaper film textbook telescreen programme play novel - with every conceivable kind of information instruction or entertainment from a statue to a slogan from a lyric poem to a biological treatise and from a child have spelling-book to a newspeak dictionary
and the ministry have not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat
there be a whole chain of separate department deal with proletarian literature music drama and entertainment generally
here be produce rubbishy newspaper contain almost nothing except sport crime and astrology sensational five-cent novelette film ooze with sex and sentimental song which be composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator
there be even a whole sub-section - pornosec he be call in newspeak - engaged in produce the low kind of pornography which be send out in seal packet and which no party member other than those who worked on he be permit to look at
three message have slide out of the pneumatic tube while winston be working but he be simple matter and he have disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted he
when the hate be over he return to he cubicle take the newspeak dictionary from the shelf pushed the speakwrite to one side clean he spectacles and settle down to he main job of the morning
winston have greatest pleasure in life be in he work
most of he be a tedious routine but included in he there be also job so difficult and intricate that he could lose himself in them as in the depth of a mathematical problem - delicate piece of forgery in which he have nothing to guide he except he knowledge of the principle of ingsoc and he estimate of what the party want he to say
winston be good at this kind of thing
on occasion he have even be entrust with the rectification of the time leading article which be write entirely in newspeak
he unroll the message that he have set aside earlier
he run :
time 3 12 83 report bb dayorder doubleplusungood ref unperson rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
in oldspeak ( or standard english ) this might be render :
the report of big brother have order for the day in the time of december 3rd 1983 be extremely unsatisfactory and make reference to non-existent person
rewrite he in full and submit he demand to high authority before file
winston read through the offend article
big brother have order for the day he seem have be chiefly devoted to praise the work of an organization known as ffcc which supply cigarette and other comfort to the sailor in the floating fortress
a certain comrade withers a prominent member of the inner party have be single out for special mention and award a decoration the order of conspicuous merit second class
three month later ffcc have suddenly be dissolve with no reason give
one could assume that withers and he associate be now in disgrace but there have be no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen
that be to be expect since he be unusual for political offender to be put on trial or even publicly denounce
the great purge involve thousand of people with public trial of traitor and think-criminal who make abject confession of he crime and be afterward execute be special show-piece not occur often than once in a couple of year
more commonly people who have incur the displeasure of the party simply disappear and be never hear of again
one never have the small clue as to what have happen to them
in some case he might not even be dead
perhaps thirty people personally known to winston not count he parent have disappear at one time or another
winston stroke he nose gently with a paper-clip
in the cubicle across the way comrade tillotson be still crouch secretively over he speakwrite
he raise he head for a moment : again the hostile spectacle-flash
winston wonder whether comrade tillotson be engaged on the same job as himself
he be perfectly possible
so tricky a piece of work would never be entrust to a single person : on the other hand to turn he over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication be taking place
very likely as many as a dozen people be now working away on rival version of what big brother have actually say
and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that would re-edit he and set in motion the complex process of cross-reference that would be require and then the choose lie would pass into the permanent record and become truth
winston do not know why withers have be disgrace
perhaps he be for corruption or incompetence
perhaps big brother be merely get rid of a too-popular subordinate
perhaps withers or someone close to he have be suspect of heretical tendency
or perhaps - what be likely of all - the thing have simply happen because purge and vaporization be a necessary part of the mechanics of government
the only real clue lay in the word ref unperson which indicate that withers be already dead
he could not invariably assume this to be the case when people be arrest
sometimes he be release and allow to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two year before be execute
very occasionally some person who he have believe dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundred of other by he testimony before vanish this time for ever
withers however be already an unperson
he do not exist : he have never exist
winston decided that he would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of big brother have speech
he be good to make he deal with something totally unconnected with he original subject
he might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitor and think-criminal but that be a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front or some triumph of over-production in the ninth three-year plan might complicate the record too much
what be need be a piece of pure fantasy
suddenly there spring into he mind ready make as he be the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who have recently die in battle in heroic circumstance
there be occasions when big brother devoted he order for the day to commemorate some humble rank-and-file party member who life and death he hold up as an example worthy to be follow
today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy
he be true that there be no such person as comrade ogilvy but a few lines of print and a couple of fake photograph would soon bring he into existence
winston think for a moment then pull the speakwrite towards he and begin dictate in big brother have familiar style : a style at once military and pedantic and because of a trick of ask question and then promptly answer them ( what lesson do he learn from this fact comrade ?
the lesson - which be also one of the fundamental principle of ingsoc - that etc etc ) easy to imitate
at the age of three comrade ogilvy have refuse all toy except a drum a sub-machine gun and a model helicopter
at six - a year early by a special relaxation of the rule - he have join the spy at nine he have be a troop leader
at eleven he have denounce he uncle to the think police after overhear a conversation which appear to he to have criminal tendency
at seventeen he have be a district organizer of the junior anti-sex league
at nine teen he have design a hand-grenade which have be adopted by the ministry of peace and which at he first trial have kill thirtyone eurasian prisoner in one burst
at twenty-three he have perished in action
pursue by enemy jet plane while flying over the indian ocean with important dispatch he have weight he body with he machine gun and leap out of the helicopter into deep water dispatch and all - an end say big brother which he be impossible to contemplate without feeling of envy
big brother add a few remarque on the purity and single-mindedness of comrade ogilvy have life
he be a total abstainer and a non-smoker have no re-creation except a daily hour in the gymnasium and have take a vow of celibacy believe marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty
he have no subject of conversation except the principle of ingsoc and no aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spy saboteur thoughtcriminals and traitor generally
winston debate with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit : in the end he decided against he because of the unnecessary cross-reference that he would entail
once again he glance at he rival in the opposite cubicle
something seem to tell he with certainty that tillotson be busy on the same job as himself
there be no way of knowing who job would finally be adopted but he feel a profound conviction that he would be he own
comrade ogilvy unimagined an hour ago be now a fact
he strike he as curious that he could create dead man but not living one
comrade ogilvy who have never exist in the present now exist in the past and when once the act of forgery be forget he would exist just as authentically and upon the same evidence as charlemagne or julius caesar
in the low canteen deep underground the lunch queue jerk slowly forward
the room be already very full and deafeningly noisy
from the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pour forth with a sour metallic smell which do not quite overcome the fume of victory gin
on the far side of the room there be a small bar a mere hole in the wall where gin could be buy at ten cent the large nip
just the man i be look for say a voice at winston have back
he turn round
he be he friend syme who worked in the research department
perhaps friend be not exactly the right word
he do not have friend nowadays he have comrade : but there be some comrade who society be pleasant than that of other
syme be a philologist a specialist in newspeak
indeed he be one of the enormous team of expert now engaged in compile the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary
he be a tiny creature small than winston with dark hair and large protuberant eyes at once mournful and derisive which seem to search he face closely while he be speaking to he
i want to ask he whether he have get any razor blade he say
not one ! say winston with a sort of guilty haste
i have try all over the place
he do exist any longer
everyone keep ask he for razor blade
actually he have two unused one which he be hoarding up
there have be a famine of them for month past
at any give moment there be some necessary article which the party shop be unable to supply
sometimes he be buttons sometimes he be darning wool sometimes he be shoelace ; at present he be razor blade
he could only get hold of them if at all by scrounge more or less furtively on the free market
i have be use the same blade for six week he add untruthfully
the queue give another jerk forward
as he halt he turn and face syme again
each of them take a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter
do he go and see the prisoner hang yesterday ?
say syme
i be working say winston indifferently
i shall see he on the flick i suppose
a very inadequate substitute say syme
he mock eyes roved over winston have face
i know he the eyes seem to say i see through he
i know very well why he do go to see those prisoner hang
in an intellectual way syme be venomously orthodox
he would talk with a disagreeable gloat satisfaction of helicopter raid on enemy village and trial and confession of think-criminal the execution in the cellar of the ministry of love
talk to he be largely a matter of get he away from such subject and entangle he if possible in the technicality of newspeak on which he be authoritative and interesting
winston turn he head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes
he be a good hanging say syme reminiscently
i think he spoils he when he tie he foot together
i like to see them kick
and above all at the end the tongue stick right out and blue a quite bright blue
that have the detail that appeal to he
nex' please ! yell the white-apron prole with the ladle
winston and syme pushed he tray beneath the grille
on to each be dump swiftly the regulation lunch - a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew a hunk of bread a cube of cheese a mug of milkless victory coffee and one saccharine tablet
there have a table over there under that telescreen say syme
let have pick up a gin on the way
the gin be serve out to them in handleless china mug
he thread he way across the crowded room and unpack he tray on to the metal-top table on one corner of which someone have left a pool of stew a filthy liquid mess that have the appearance of vomit
winston take up he mug of gin pause for an instant to collect he nerve and gulp the oily-taste stuff down
when he have wink the tears out of he eyes he suddenly discover that he be hungry
he begin swallow spoonful of the stew which in amongst he general sloppiness have cube of spongy pinkish stuff which be probably a preparation of meat
neither of them spoke again till he have empty he pannikin
from the table at winston have left a little behind he back someone be talk rapidly and continuously a harsh gabble almost like the quack of a duck which pierce the general uproar of the room
how be the dictionary get on ?
say winston raising he voice to overcome the noise
slowly say syme
i be on the adjective
he have fascinating
he have brighten up immediately at the mention of newspeak
he pushed he pannikin aside take up he hunk of bread in one delicate hand and he cheese in the other and lean across the table so as to be able to speak without shout
the eleventh edition be the definitive edition he say
he be get the language into he final shape - the shape he have going to have when nobody speak anything else
when he have finished with he people like he will have to learn he all over again
he think i dare say that he chief job be invent new word
but not a bit of he !
he be destroy word - score of them hundred of them every day
he be cutting the language down to the bone
the eleventh edition will contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 2050
he bit hungrily into he bread and swallow a couple of mouthful then continue speaking with a sort of pedant have passion
he thin dark face have become animate he eyes have lose he mock expression and grown almost dreamy
he have a beautiful thing the destruction of word
of course the great wastage be in the verb and adjective but there be hundred of noun that can be get rid of as well
he be only the synonym ; there be also the antonym
after all what justification be there for a word which be simply the opposite of some other word ?
a word contain he opposite in himself
take good for instance
if he have a word like good what need be there for a word like bad ?
ungood will do just as well - good because he have an exact opposite which the other be not
or again if he want a strong version of good what sense be there in have a whole string of vague useless word like excellent and splendid and all the rest of them ?
plusgood cover the meaning or doubleplusgood if he want something strong still
of course he use those forme already but in the final version of newspeak there will be nothing else
in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be cover by only six word - in reality only one word
do he see the beauty of that winston ?
he be b b have idea originally of course he add as an afterthought
a sort of vapid eagerness flit across winston have face at the mention of big brother
nevertheless syme immediately detect a certain lack of enthusiasm
he have a real appreciation of newspeak winston he say almost sadly
even when he write he he be still thinking in oldspeak
i have read some of those piece that he write in the time occasionally
he be good enough but he be translation
in he heart he have prefer to stick to oldspeak with all he vagueness and he useless shades of meaning
he do grasp the beauty of the destruction of word
do he know that newspeak be the only language in the world who vocabulary get small every year ?
winston do know that of course
he smile sympathetically he hope not trustful himself to speak
syme bit off another fragment of the dark-colored bread chew he briefly and go on :
do he see that the whole aim of newspeak be to narrow the range of think ?
in the end he shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be no word in which to express he
every concept that can ever be need will be express by exactly one word with he meaning rigidly define and all he subsidiary meaning rub out and forget
already in the eleventh edition he be not far from that point
but the process will still be continue long after he and i be dead
every year few and few word and the range of consciousness always a little small
even now of course there have no reason or excuse for commit thoughtcrime
he have merely a question of self-discipline reality-control
but in the end there will be any need even for that
the revolution will be complete when the language be perfect
newspeak be ingsoc and ingsoc be newspeak he add with a sort of mystical satisfaction
have he ever occur to he winston that by the year 2050 at the very latest not a single human be will be alive who could understand such a conversation as he be have now ?
except - begin winston doubtfully and he stopped
he have be on the tip of he tongue to say except the prole but he checked himself not feeling fully certain that this remarque be not in some way unorthodox
syme however have divine what he be about to say
the prole be not human being he say carelessly
by 2050 earlier probably - all real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappear
the whole literature of the past will have be destroy
chaucer shakespeare milton byron - he will exist only in newspeak version not merely change into something different but actually change into something contradictory of what he used to be
even the literature of the party will change
even the slogan will change
how could he have a slogan like freedom be slavery when the concept of freedom have be abolish ?
the whole climate of think will be different
in fact there will be no think as he understand he now
orthodoxy means not thinking - not need to think
orthodoxy be unconsciousness
one of these days think winston with sudden deep conviction syme will be vaporize
he be too intelligent
he see too clearly and speak too plainly
the party do not like such people
one day he will disappear
he be write in he face
winston have finished he bread and cheese
he turn a little sideways in he chair to drink he mug of coffee
at the table on he left the man with the strident voice be still talk remorselessly away
a young woman who be perhaps he secretary and who be sitting with he back to winston be listen to he and seem to be eagerly agree with everything that he say
from time to time winston catch some such remarque as i think he be so right i do so agree with he utter in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice
but the other voice never stopped for an instant even when the girl be speaking
winston know the man by sight though he know no more about he than that he hold some important post in the fiction department
he be a man of about thirty with a muscular throat and a large mobile mouth
he head be throw back a little and because of the angle at which he be sitting he spectacles catch the light and present to winston two blank disc instead of eyes
what be slightly horrible be that from the stream of sound that pour out of he mouth he be almost impossible to distinguish a single word
just once winston catch a phrase - complete and final elimination of goldsteinism - jerk out very rapidly and as he seem all in one piece like a line of type cast solid
for the rest he be just a noise a quackquack-quack
and yet though he could not actually hear what the man be saying he could not be in any doubt about he general nature
he might be denounce goldstein and demanding stern measures against think-criminal and saboteur he might be fulminate against the atrocity of the eurasian army he might be praise big brother or the hero on the malabar front - he make no difference
whatever he be he could be certain that every word of he be pure orthodoxy pure ingsoc
as he watch the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down winston have a curious feeling that this be not a real human be but some kind of dummy
he be not the man have brain that be speaking he be he larynx
the stuff that be coming out of he consist of word but he be not speech in the true sense : he be a noise utter in unconsciousness like the quack of a duck
syme have fall silent for a moment and with the handle of he spoon be tracing pattern in the puddle of stew
the voice from the other table quack rapidly on easily audible in spite of the surround din
there be a word in newspeak say syme i do know whether he know he : duckspeak to quack like a duck
he be one of those interesting word that have two contradictory meaning
applied to an opponent he be abuse applied to someone he agree with he be praise
unquestionably syme will be vaporize winston think again
he think he with a kind of sadness although well knowing that syme despise he and slightly dislike he and be fully capable of denounce he as a think-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so
there be something subtly wrong with syme
there be something that he lack : discretion aloofness a sort of saving stupidity
he could not say that he be unorthodox
he believe in the principle of ingsoc he venerate big brother he rejoice over victory he hate heretic not merely with sincereness but with a sort of restless zeal an up-to-dateness of information which the ordinary party member do not approach
yet a faint air of disreputability always cling to he
he say thing that would have be good unsaid he have read too many book he frequent the chestnut tree cafe haunt of painter and musician
there be no law not even an unwritten law against frequent the chestnut tree cafe yet the place be somehow ill-omened
the old discredit leader of the party have be used to gather there before he be finally purge
goldstein himself he be say have sometimes be see there year and decade ago
syme have fate be not difficult to foresee
and yet he be a fact that if syme grasp even for three second the nature of he winston have secret opinion he would betray he instantly to the think police
so would anybody else for that matter : but syme more than most
zeal be not enough
orthodoxy be unconsciousness
syme look up
here come parson he say
something in the tone of he voice seem to add that bloody fool
parson winston have fellow-tenant at victory mansion be in fact thread he way across the room - a tubby middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face
at thirty-five he be already putt on roll of fat at neck and waist-line but he movement be brisk and boyish
he whole appearance be that of a little boy grown large so much so that although he be wearing the regulation overall he be almost impossible not to think of he as be dress in the blue shorts grey shirt and red neckerchief of the spy
in visualize he one saw always a picture of dimple knee and sleeve roll back from pudgy forearm
parson do indeed invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity give he an excuse for doing so
he greet them both with a cheery hullo hullo ! and sit down at the table give off an intense smell of sweat
bead of moisture stand out all over he pink face
he power of sweat be extraordinary
at the community center he could always tell when he have be play table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle
syme have produce a strip of paper on which there be a long column of word and be study he with an ink-pencil between he finger
look at he working away in the lunch hour say parson nudge winston
keenness eh ?
what have that he have get there old boy ?
something a bit too brainy for he i expect
smith old boy i will tell he why i be chase he
he have that sub he forget to give he
which sub be that ?
say winston automatically feeling for money
about a quarter of one have salary have to be earmark for voluntary subscription which be so numerous that he be difficult to keep track of them
for hate week
he know - the house-by-house fund
i be treasurer for he block
he be making an all-out effort - going to put on a tremendous show
i tell he he will be he fault if old victory mansion do have the big outfit of flagstone in the whole street
two dollar he promise he
winston found and hand over two crease and filthy notes which parson enter in a small notebook in the neat handwriting of the illiterate
by the way old boy he say i hear that little beggar of mine let fly at he with he catapult yesterday
i give he a good dressing down for he
in fact i tell he i have take the catapult away if he do he again
i think he be a little upset at not going to the execution say winston
ah well - what i mean to say show the right spirit do he ?
mischievous little beggar he be both of them but talk about keenness !
all he think about be the spy and the war of course
d' he know what that little girl of mine do last saturday when he troop be on a hike out berkhamsted way ?
he get two other girl to go with he slip off from the hike and spend the whole afternoon following a strange man
he keep on he tail for two hours right through the woods and then when he get into amersham hand he over to the patrol
what do he do that for ?
say winston somewhat take aback
parson go on triumphantly :
he kid make sure he be some kind of enemy agent - might have be drop by parachute for instance
but here have the point old boy
what do he think put he on to he in the first place ?
he spotted he be wearing a funny kind of shoe - say he have never see anyone wearing shoe like that before
so the chance be he be a foreigner
pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh ?
what happen to the man ?
say winston
ah that i could say of course
but i would be altogether surprise if - parson make the motion of aim a rifle and click he tongue for the explosion
good say syme abstractedly without look up from he strip of paper
of course he can afford to take chance agreed winston dutifully
what i mean to say there be a war on say parson
as though in confirmation of this a trumpet call float from the telescreen just above he heads
however he be not the proclamation of a military victory this time but merely an announcement from the ministry of plenty
comrade ! cry an eagre youthful voice
attention comrade !
he have glorious news for he
he have win the battle for production !
return now complete of the output of all classis of consumption goods show that the standard of living have rise by no less than 20 per cent over the past year
all over oceania this morning there be irrepressible spontaneous demonstration when worker march out of factory and office and parade through the street with banner voice he gratitude to big brother for the new happy life which he wise leadership have bestow upon he
here be some of the complete figure
food-stuff -
the phrase he new happy life recur several time
he have be a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty
parson he attention catch by the trumpet call sit listen with a sort of gape solemnity a sort of edify boredom
he could not follow the figure but he be aware that he be in some way a cause for satisfaction
he have lug out a huge and filthy pipe which be already half full of char tobacco
with the tobacco ration at 100 gram a week he be seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top
winston be smoke a victory cigarette which he hold carefully horizontal
the new ration do not start till tomorrow and he have only four cigarette left
for the moment he have shut he ear to the remote noise and be listen to the stuff that stream out of the telescreen
he appear that there have even be demonstration to thank big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty gram a week
and only yesterday he reflect he have be announce that the ration be to be reduce to twenty gram a week
be he possible that he could swallow that after only twenty-four hours ?
yes he swallow he
parson swallow he easily with the stupidity of an animal
the eyeless creature at the other table swallow he fanatically passionately with a furious desire to track down denounce and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration have be thirty gram
syme too - in some more complex way involve double-think syme swallow he
be he then alone in the possession of a memory ?
the fabulous statistics continue to pour out of the telescreen
as compare with last year there be more food more clothes more house more furniture more cook-pot more fuel more ship more helicopter more book more baby - more of everything except disease crime and insanity
year by year and minute by minute everybody and everything be whiz rapidly upward
as syme have done earlier winston have take up he spoon and be dabble in the pale-colored gravy that dribble across the table drawing a long streak of he out into a pattern
he meditate resentfully on the physical texture of life
have he always be like this ?
have food always taste like this ?
he look round the canteen
a low crowded room he wall grimy from the contact of innumerable body ; batter metal table and chair place so close together that he sit with elbow touching ; bent spoon dent tray coarse white mug ; all surface greasy grime in every crack ; and a sourish composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes
always in he stomach and in he skin there be a sort of protest a feeling that he have be cheat of something that he have a right to
he be true that he have no memory of anything greatly different
in any time that he could accurately remember there have never be quite enough to eat one have never have sock or underclothes that be not full of hole furniture have always be batter and rickety room underheated tube train crowded house fall to piece bread dark-colored tea a rarity coffee filthy-taste cigarette insufficient - nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin
and though of course he grow bad as one have body aged be he not a sign that this be not the natural order of thing if one have heart sicken at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity the interminable winter the stickiness of one have sock the lift that never worked the cold water the gritty soap the cigarette that came to piece the food with he strange evil taste ?
why should one feel he to be intolerable unless one have some kind of ancestral memory that thing have once be different ?
he look round the canteen again
nearly everyone be ugly and would still have be ugly even if dress otherwise than in the uniform blue overall
on the far side of the room sitting at a table alone a small curiously beetle-like man be drink a cup of coffee he little eyes dart suspicious glance from side to side
how easy he be think winston if he do not look about he to believe that the physical type set up by the party as an ideal - tall muscular youth and deep-bosom maiden blond vital sunburnt carefree - exist and even predominate
actually so far as he could judge the majority of people in airstrip one be small dark and ill-favoured
he be curious how that beetle-like type proliferate in the ministry : little dumpy man grow stout very early in life with short leg swift scuttle movement and fat inscrutable face with very small eyes
he be the type that seem to flourish good under the dominium of the party
the announcement from the ministry of plenty end on another trumpet call and give way to tinny music
parson stir to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figure take he pipe out of he mouth
the ministry of plenty have certainly done a good job this year he say with a knowing shake of he head
by the way smith old boy i suppose he have get any razor blade he can let he have ?
not one say winston
i have be use the same blade for six week himself
ah well - just think i have ask he old boy
sorry say winston
the quack voice from the next table temporarily silence during the ministry have announcement have start up again as loud as ever
for some reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parson with he wispy hair and the dust in the crease of he face
within two year those child would be denounce he to the think police
mrs parson would be vaporize
syme would be vaporize
winston would be vaporize
o'brien would be vaporize
parson on the other hand would never be vaporize
the eyeless creature with the quack voice would never be vaporize
the little beetle-like man who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridor of ministry he too would never be vaporize
and the girl with dark hair the girl from the fiction department - he would never be vaporize either
he seem to he that he know instinctively who would survive and who would perish : though just what he be that make for survival he be not easy to say
at this moment he be drag out of he reverie with a violent jerk
the girl at the next table have turn partly round and be look at he
he be the girl with dark hair
he be look at he in a sidelong way but with curious intensity
the instant he catch he eye he look away again
the sweat start out on winston have backbone
a horrible pang of terror go through he
he be go almost at once but he left a sort of nag uneasiness behind
why be he watch he ?
why do he keep following he about ?
unfortunately he could not remember whether he have already be at the table when he arrive or have come there afterward
but yesterday at any rate during the two minutes hate he have sit immediately behind he when there be no apparent need to do so
quite likely he real object have be to listen to he and make sure whether he be shout loudly enough
he earlier think return to he : probably he be not actually a member of the think police but then he be precisely the amateur spy who be the greatest danger of all
he do not know how long he have be look at he but perhaps for as much as five minutes and he be possible that he feature have not be perfectly under control
he be terribly dangerous to let he thought wander when he be in any public place or within range of a telescreen
the small thing could give he away
a nervous tic an unconscious look of anxiety a habit of mutter to himself - anything that carry with he the suggestion of abnormality of have something to hide
in any case to wear an improper expression on he face ( to look incredulous when a victory be announce for example ) be himself a punishable offence
there be even a word for he in newspeak : facecrime he be call
the girl have turn he back on he again
perhaps after all he be not really following he about perhaps he be coincidence that he have sit so close to he two days running
he cigarette have go out and he lay he carefully on the edge of the table
he would finish smoke he after work if he could keep the tobacco in he
quite likely the person at the next table be a spy of the think police and quite likely he would be in the cellar of the ministry of love within three days but a cigarette end musth not be waste
syme have fold up he strip of paper and stow he away in he pocket
parson have begin talk again
do i ever tell he old boy he say chuckle round the stem of he pipe about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market-woman have skirt because he saw he wrapping up sausage in a poster of b b ?
sneak up behind he and set fire to he with a box of match
burned he quite badly i believe
little beggar eh ?
but keen as mustard !
that have a first-rate training he give them in the spy nowadays - good than in he day even
what d' he think have the latest thing he have serve them out with ?
ear trumpet for listen through keyhole !
he little girl bring one home the other night - try he out on he sitting-room door and reckon he could hear twice as much as with he ear to the hole
of course he have only a toy mind he
still give 'em the right idea eh ?
at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle
he be the signal to return to work
all three man spring to he foot to join in the struggle round the lift and the remain tobacco fell out of winston have cigarette
winston be writing in he diary :
he be three year ago
he be on a dark evening in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway station
he be standing near a doorway in the wall under a street lamp that hardly give any light
he have a young face paint very thick
he be really the paint that appeal to he the whiteness of he like a masque and the bright red lip
party woman never paint he face
there be nobody else in the street and no telescreens
he say two dollar
i -
for the moment he be too difficult to go on
he shut he eyes and press he finger against them trying to squeeze out the vision that keep recur
he have an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy word at the top of he voice
or to bang he head against the wall to kick over the table and hurl the inkpot through the window - to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that be torment he
he bad enemy he reflect be he own nervous system
at any moment the tension inside he be liable to translate himself into some visible symptom
he think of a man who he have pass in the street a few week back ; a quite ordinary-look man a party member aged thirty-five to forty tallish and thin carry a brief-case
he be a few metre apart when the left side of the man have face be suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm
he happen again just as he be passing one another : he be only a twitch a quiver rapid as the click of a camera shutter but obviously habitual
he remember thinking at the time : that poor devil be done for
and what be frighten be that the action be quite possibly unconscious
the most deadly danger of all be talk in he sleep
there be no way of guard against that so far as he could see
he draw he breath and go on writing :
i go with he through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen
there be a bed against the wall and a lamp on the table turn down very low
he -
he tooth be set on edge
he would have like to spit
simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he think of katharine he wife
winston be married - have be married at any rate : probably he still be married so far as he know he wife be not dead
he seem to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compound of bug and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring because no woman of the party ever used scent or could be imagine as doing so
only the prole used scent
in he mind the smell of he be inextricably mixed up with fornication
when he have go with that woman he have be he first lapse in two year or thereabout
consort with prostitute be forbid of course but he be one of those rule that he could occasionally nerve himself to break
he be dangerous but he be not a life-and-death matter
to be catch with a prostitute might mean five year in a forced-labor camp : not more if he have commit no other offence
and he be easy enough provided that he could avoid be catch in the act
the poor quarters swarm with woman who be ready to sell himself
some could even be purchase for a bottle of gin which the prole be not supposed to drink
tacitly the party be even inclined to encourage prostitution as an outlet for instinct which could not be altogether suppress
mere debauchery do not matter very much so long as he be furtive and joyless and only involved the woman of a submerged and despise class
the unforgivable crime be promiscuity between party member
but - though this be one of the crime that the accused in the great purge invariably confess to - he be difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening
the aim of the party be not merely to prevent man and woman from form loyalty which he might not be able to control
he real undeclared purpose be to remove all pleasure from the sexual act
not love so much as eroticism be the enemy inside marriage as well as outside he
all marriage between party member have to be approve by a committee appoint for the purpose and - though the principle be never clearly stated - permission be always refuse if the couple concerned give the impression of be physically attract to one another
the only recognize purpose of marriage be to beget child for the service of the party
sexual intercourse be to be look on as a slightly disgusting minor operation like have an enema
this again be never put into plain word but in an indirect way he be rub into every party member from childhood onward
there be even organization such as the junior anti-sex league which advocate complete celibacy for both sex
all child be to be beget by artificial insemination ( artsem he be call in newspeak ) and bring up in public institution
this winston be aware be not mean altogether seriously but somehow he fitted in with the general ideology of the party
the party be trying to kill the sex instinct or if he could not be kill then to distort he and dirty he
he do not know why this be so but he seem natural that he should be so
and as far as the woman be concerned the party have effort be largely successful
he think again of katharine
he musth be nine ten - nearly eleven year since he have parted
he be curious how seldom he think of he
for days at a time he be capable of forget that he have ever be married
he have only be together for about fifteen month
the party do not permit divorce but he rather encourage separation in case where there be no child
katharine be a tall fair girl very straight with splendid movement
he have a bold aquiline face a face that one might have call noble until one discover that there be as nearly as possible nothing behind he
very early in he married life he have decided - though perhaps he be only that he know he more intimately than he know most people - that he have without exception the most stupid vulgar empty mind that he have ever encounter
he have not a think in he head that be not a slogan and there be no imbecility absolutely none that he be not capable of swallow if the party hand he out to he
the human sound-track he nickname he in he own mind
yet he could have endure living with he if he have not be for just one thing - sex
as soon as he touched he he seem to wince and stiffen
to embrace he be like embrace a jointed wooden image
and what be strange be that even when he be clasp he against he he have the feeling that he be simultaneously pushing he away with all he strength
the rigidity of he muscle manage to convey that impression
he would lie there with shut eyes neither resist nor cooperate but submit
he be extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible
but even then he could have bear living with he if he have be agreed that he should remain celibate
but curiously enough he be katharine who refuse this
he musth he say produce a child if he could
so the performance continue to happen once a week quite regularity whenever he be not impossible
he even used to remind he of he in the morning as something which have to be done that evening and which musth not be forget
he have two name for he
one be making a baby and the other be he duty to the party ( yes he have actually used that phrase ) 
quite soon he grow to have a feeling of positive dread when the appoint day came round
but luckily no child appear and in the end he agreed to give up trying and soon afterward he parted
winston sigh inaudibly
he pick up he pen again and write :
he throw himself down on the bed and at once without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way he can imagine pull up he skirt
i -
he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight with the smell of bug and cheap scent in he nostril and in he heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment be mixed up with the think of katharine have white body freeze for ever by the hypnotic power of the party
why do he always have to be like this ?
why could he not have a woman of he own instead of these filthy scuffle at interval of year ?
but a real love affair be an almost unthinkable event
the woman of the party be all alike
chastity be as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty
by careful early conditioning by game and cold water by the rubbish that be din into them at school and in the spy and the youth league by lecture parade song slogan and martial music the natural feeling have be drive out of them
he reason tell he that there musth be exception but he heart do not believe he
he be all impregnable as the party intended that he should be
and what he want more even than to be love be to break down that wall of virtue even if he be only once in he whole life
the sexual act successfully perform be rebellion
desire be thoughtcrime
even to have awaken katharine if he could have achieve he would have be like a seduction although he be he wife
but the rest of the storey have get to be write down
he write :
i turn up the lamp
when i saw he in the light -
after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp have seem very bright
for the first time he could see the woman properly
he have take a step towards he and then halt full of lust and terror
he be painfully conscious of the risk he have take in coming here
he be perfectly possible that the patrol would catch he on the way out : for that matter he might be wait outside the door at this moment
if he go away without even doing what he have come here to do - !
he have get to be write down he have get to be confess
what he have suddenly see in the lamplight be that the woman be old
the paint be plastered so thick on he face that he look as though he might crack like a cardboard masque
there be streak of white in he hair ; but the truly dreadful detail be that he mouth have fall a little open reveal nothing except a cavernous blackness
he have no tooth at all
he write hurriedly in scrabble handwriting :
when i saw he in the light he be quite an old woman fifty year old at least
but i go ahead and do he just the same
he press he finger against he eyelid again
he have write he down at last but he make no difference
the therapy have not worked
the urge to shout filthy word at the top of he voice be as strong as ever
if there be hope [ write winston ] he lie in the prole
if there be hope he musth lie in the prole because only there in those swarm disregard masses 85 per cent of the population of oceania could the force to destroy the party ever be generate
the party could not be overthrow from within
he enemy if he have any enemy have no way of coming together or even of identify one another
even if the legendary brotherhood exist as just possibly he might he be inconceivable that he member could ever assemble in large number than two and three
rebellion mean a look in the eyes an inflection of the voice at the most an occasional whisper word
but the prole if only he could somehow become conscious of he own strength would have no need to conspire
he need only to rise up and shake himself like a horse shake off fly
if he chose he could blow the party to piece tomorrow morning
surely sooner or later he musth occur to them to do he ?
and yet - !
he remember how once he have be walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundred of voice woman have voice - have burst from a side-street a little way ahead
he be a great formidable cry of anger and despair a deep loud oh-o-o-o-oh ! that go hum on like the reverberation of a bell
he heart have leap
he have start ! he have think
a riot !
the prole be breaking loose at last !
when he have reach the spot he be to see a mob of two or three hundred woman crowd round the stall of a street market with face as tragic as though he have be the doom passenger on a sinking ship
but at this moment the general despair break down into a multitude of individual quarrel
he appear that one of the stall have be selling tin saucepan
he be wretched flimsy thing but cook-pot of any kind be always difficult to get
now the supply have unexpectedly give out
the successful woman bump and jostle by the rest be trying to make off with he saucepan while dozen of other clamour round the stall accuse the stallkeeper of favouritism and of have more saucepan somewhere in reserve
there be a fresh outburst of yell
two bloat woman one of them with he hair coming down have get hold of the same saucepan and be trying to tear he out of one another have hands
for a moment he be both tug and then the handle came off
winston watch them disgustedly
and yet just for a moment what almost frighten power have sound in that cry from only a few hundred throat !
why be he that he could never shout like that about anything that matter ?
he write :
until he become conscious he will never rebel and until after he have rebel he can become conscious
that he reflect might almost have be a transcription from one of the party textbook
the party claim of course to have liberate the prole from bondage
before the revolution he have be hideously oppress by the capitalist he have be starve and flog woman have be forced to work in the coal mine ( woman still do work in the coal mine as a matter of fact ) child have be sell into the factory at the age of six
but simultaneously true to the principle of double-think the party teach that the prole be natural inferior who musth be keep in subjection like animal by the application of a few simple rule
in reality very little be known about the prole
he be not necessary to know much
so long as he continue to work and breed he other activity be without importance
left to himself like cattle turn loose upon the plains of argentina he have revert to a style of life that appear to be natural to them a sort of ancestral pattern
he be born he grow up in the gutter he go to work at twelve he pass through a brief blossom-period of beauty and sexual desire he married at twenty he be middle-aged at thirty he die for the most part at sixty
heavy physical work the care of home and child petty quarrel with neighbour film football beer and above all gambling fill up the horizon of he mind
to keep them in control be not difficult
a few agent of the think police move always amongst them spread false rumour and marking down and eliminate the few individual who be judge capable of becoming dangerous ; but no attempt be make to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party
he be not desirable that the prole should have strong political feeling
all that be require of them be a primitive patriotism which could be appeal to whenever he be necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or short rations
and even when he become discontent as he sometimes do he discontent lead nowhere because be without general idea he could only focus he on petty specific grievance
the large evil invariably escape he notice
the great majority of prole do not even have telescreens in he home
even the civil police interfere with them very little
there be a vast amount of criminality in london a whole world-within-a-world of thieve bandit prostitute drug-peddler and racketeer of every description ; but since he all happen amongst the prole himself he be of no importance
in all question of moral he be allow to follow he ancestral code
the sexual puritanism of the party be not impose upon them
promiscuity go unpunished divorce be permit
for that matter even religious worship would have be permit if the prole have show any sign of need or wanting he
he be beneath suspicion
as the party slogan put he : prole and animal be free
winston reach down and cautiously scratch he varicose ulcer
he have begin itch again
the thing he invariably came back to be the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution have really be like
he take out of the drawer a copy of a child have history textbook which he have borrow from mrs parson and begin copy a passage into the diary :
in the old days [ he run ] before the glorious revolution london be not the beautiful city that he know today
he be a dark dirty miserable place where hardly anybody have enough to eat and where hundred and thousand of poor people have no boots on he foot and not even a roof to sleep under
child no old than he have to work twelve hours a day for cruel master who flog them with whips if he worked too slowly and feed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water
but in amongst all this terrible poverty there be just a few great big beautiful house that be live in by rich man who have as many as thirty servant to look after them
these rich man be call capitalist
he be fat ugly man with wicked face like the one in the picture on the opposite page
he can see that he be dress in a long black coat which be call a frock coat and a queer shiny hat shape like a stove-pipe which be call a top hat
this be the uniform of the capitalist and no one else be allow to wear he
the capitalist own everything in the world and everyone else be he slave
he own all the land all the house all the factory and all the money
if anyone disobey them he could throw them into prison or he could take he job away and starve he to death
when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he have to cringe and bow to he and take off he cap and address he as sir
the chief of all the capitalist be call the kingbolt and -
but he know the rest of the catalogue
there would be mention of the bishop in he lawn sleeve the judge in he ermine robe the pillory the stocks the tread-mill the cat-o'-nine tails the lord mayor have banquet and the practice of kissing the pope have toe
there be also something call the jus primae noctis which would probably not be mention in a textbook for child
he be the law by which every capitalist have the right to sleep with any woman working in one of he factory
how could he tell how much of he be lie ?
he might be true that the average human be be good off now than he have be before the revolution
the only evidence to the contrary be the mute protest in he own bone the instinctive feeling that the condition he live in be intolerable and that at some other time he musth have be different
he strike he that the truly characteristic thing about modern life be not he cruelty and insecurity but simply he bareness he dinginess he listlessness
life if he look about he bore no resemblance not only to the lie that stream out of the telescreens but even to the ideal that the party be trying to achieve
great area of he even for a party member be neutral and non-political a matter of slog through dreary job fight for a place on the tube darning a worn-out sock cadge a saccharine tablet saving a cigarette end
the ideal set up by the party be something huge terrible and glitter - a world of steel and concrete of monstrous machine and terrify weapon - a nation of warrior and fanatic march forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thought and shout the same slogan perpetually working fight triumph persecute - three hundred million people all with the same face
the reality be decay dingy city where underfeed people shuffle to and fro in leaky shoe in patch-up nineteenth-century house that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatory
he seem to see a vision of london vast and ruinous city of a million dustbin and mixed up with he be a picture of mrs parson a woman with line face and wispy hair fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe
he reach down and scratch he ankle again
day and night the telescreens bruised he ear with statistics prove that people today have more food more clothes good house good re-creation - that he live longer worked short hours be big healthy strong happy more intelligent good educated than the people of fifty year ago
not a word of he could ever be prove or disprove
the party claim for example that today 40 per cent of adult prole be literate : before the revolution he be say the number have only be 15 per cent
the party claim that the infant mortality rate be now only 160 per thousand whereas before the revolution he have be 300 - and so he go on
he be like a single equation with two unknown
he might very well be that literally every word in the history book even the thing that one accepted without question be pure fantasy
for all he know there might never have be any such law as the jus primae noctis or any such creature as a capitalist or any such garment as a top hat
everything fade into mist
the past be erase the erasure be forget the lie become truth
just once in he life he have possessed - after the event : that be what count - concrete unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification
he have hold he between he finger for as long as thirty second
in 1973 he musth have be - at any rate he be at about the time when he and katharine have parted
but the really relevant date be seven or eight year earlier
the storey really begin in the middle sixty the period of the great purge in which the original leader of the revolution be wipe out once and for all
by 1970 none of them be left except big brother himself
all the rest have by that time be exposed as traitor and counter-revolutionary
goldstein have flee and be hiding no one know where and of the other a few have simply disappear while the majority have be execute after spectacular public trial at which he make confession of he crime
amongst the last survivor be three man name jones aaronson and rutherford
he musth have be in 1965 that these three have be arrest
as often happen he have vanish for a year or more so that one do not know whether he be alive or dead and then have suddenly be bring forth to incriminate himself in the usual way
he have confess to intelligence with the enemy ( at that date too the enemy be eurasia ) embezzlement of public funds the murder of various trust party member intrigue against the leadership of big brother which have start long before the revolution happen and act of sabotage cause the death of hundred of thousand of people
after confess to these thing he have be pardon reinstate in the party and give post which be in fact sinecure but which sound important
all three have write long abject article in the time analyse the reason for he defection and promising to make amends
some time after he release winston have actually see all three of them in the chestnut tree cafe
he remember the sort of terrify fascination with which he have watch them out of the corner of he eye
he be man far old than himself relic of the ancient world almost the last great figure left over from the heroic days of the party
the glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly cling to them
he have the feeling though already at that time facts and dates be grow blurry that he have known he name year earlier than he have known that of big brother
but also he be outlaw enemy untouchable doom with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two
no one who have once fall into the hands of the think police ever escape in the end
he be corpse wait to be send back to the grave
there be no one at any of the table near to them
he be not wise even to be see in the neighbourhood of such people
he be sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavour with clove which be the speciality of the cafe
of the three he be rutherford who appearance have most impress winston
rutherford have once be a famous caricaturist who brutal cartoon have help to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution
even now at long interval he cartoon be appear in the time
he be simply an imitation of he earlier manner and curiously lifeless and unconvincing
always he be a rehash of the ancient theme - slum tenement starve child street battle capitalist in top hat - even on the barricade the capitalist still seem to cling to he top hat an endless hopeless effort to get back into the past
he be a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey hair he face pouched and seam with thick negroid lip
at one time he musth have be immensely strong ; now he great body be sag sloping bulge fall away in every direction
he seem to be breaking up before one have eyes like a mountain crumble
he be the lonely hour of fifteen
winston could not now remember how he have come to be in the cafe at such a time
the place be almost empty
a tinny music be trickle from the telescreens
the three man sit in he corner almost motionless never speaking
uncommanded the waiter bring fresh glasses of gin
there be a chessboard on the table beside them with the piece set out but no game start
and then for perhaps half a minute in all something happen to the telescreens
the tune that he be play change and the tone of the music change too
there came into he - but he be something hard to describe
he be a peculiar cracked bray jeer note : in he mind winston call he a yellow note
and then a voice from the telescreen be sing :
under the spread chestnut tree
i sell he and he sell he :
there lie he and here lie he
under the spread chestnut tree
the three man never stir
but when winston glance again at rutherford have ruinous face he saw that he eyes be full of tears
and for the first time he notice with a kind of inward shudder and yet not knowing at what he shudder that both aaronson and rutherford have break nose
a little later all three be re-arrest
he appear that he have engaged in fresh conspiracy from the very moment of he release
at he second trial he confess to all he old crime over again with a whole string of new one
he be execute and he fate be record in the party history a warning to posterity
about five year after this in 1973 winston be unroll a wad of document which have just flop out of the pneumatic tube on to he desk when he came on a fragment of paper which have evidently be slip in amongst the other and then forget
the instant he have flatten he out he saw he significance
he be a half-page tear out of the time of about ten year earlier - the top half of the page so that he included the date - and he contain a photograph of the delegate at some party function in new york
prominent in the middle of the group be jones aaronson and rutherford
there be no mistake them in any case he name be in the caption at the bottom
the point be that at both trial all three man have confess that on that date he have be on eurasian soil
he have fly from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvous somewhere in siberia and have confer with member of the eurasian general staff to who he have betray important military secret
the date have stick in winston have memory because he chance to be midsummer day ; but the whole storey musth be on record in countless other place as well
there be only one possible conclusion : the confession be lie
of course this be not in himself a discovery
even at that time winston have not imagine that the people who be wipe out in the purge have actually commit the crime that he be accused of
but this be concrete evidence ; he be a fragment of the abolish past like a fossil bone which turn up in the wrong stratum and destroy a geological theory
he be enough to blow the party to atom if in some way he could have be publish to the world and he significance make known
he have go straight on working
as soon as he saw what the photograph be and what he mean he have cover he up with another sheet of paper
luckily when he unroll he he have be upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen
he take he scribble pad on he knee and pushed back he chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible
to keep he face expressionless be not difficult and even he breathing could be control with an effort : but he could not control the beating of he heart and the telescreen be quite delicate enough to pick he up
he let what he judge to be ten minutes go by torment all the while by the fear that some accident - a sudden draught blow across he desk for instance - would betray he
then without uncover he again he drop the photograph into the memory hole along with some other waste paper
within another minute perhaps he would have crumble into ashes
that be ten - eleven year ago
today probably he would have keep that photograph
he be curious that the fact of have hold he in he finger seem to he to make a difference even now when the photograph himself as well as the event he record be only memory
be the party have hold upon the past less strong he wonder because a piece of evidence which exist no longer have once exist ?
but today suppose that he could be somehow resurrect from he ashes the photograph might not even be evidence
already at the time when he make he discovery oceania be no longer at war with eurasia and he musth have be to the agent of eastasia that the three dead man have betray he country
since then there have be other change - two three he could not remember how many
very likely the confession have be rewrite and rewrite until the original facts and dates no longer have the small significance
the past not only change but change continuously
what most afflict he with the sense of nightmare be that he have never clearly understand why the huge imposture be undertake
the immediate advantage of falsify the past be obvious but the ultimate motive be mysterious
he take up he pen again and write :
i understand how : i do not understand why
he wonder as he have many time wonder before whether he himself be a lunatic
perhaps a lunatic be simply a minority of one
at one time he have be a sign of madness to believe that the earth go round the sun ; today to believe that the past be inalterable
he might be alone in holding that belief and if alone then a lunatic
but the think of be a lunatic do not greatly trouble he : the horror be that he might also be wrong
he pick up the child have history book and look at the portrait of big brother which form he frontispiece
the hypnotic eyes gaze into he own
he be as though some huge force be pressing down upon he - something that penetrate inside he skull batter against he brain frighten he out of he belief persuade he almost to deny the evidence of he sense
in the end the party would announce that two and two make five and he would have to believe he
he be inevitable that he should make that claim sooner or later : the logic of he position demand he
not merely the validity of experience but the very existence of external reality be tacitly deny by he philosophy
the heresy of heresy be common sense
and what be terrify be not that he would kill he for thinking otherwise but that he might be right
for after all how do he know that two and two make four ?
or that the force of gravity works ?
or that the past be unchangeable ?
if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind himself be controllable what then ?
but no !
he courage seem suddenly to stiffen of he own accord
the face of o'brien not call up by any obvious association have float into he mind
he know with more certainty than before that o'brien be on he side
he be writing the diary for o'brien - to o'brien : he be like an interminable letter which no one would ever read but which be address to a particular person and take he colour from that fact
the party tell he to reject the evidence of he eyes and ear
he be he final most essential command
he heart sink as he think of the enormous power array against he the ease with which any party intellectual would overthrow he in debate the subtle argument which he would not be able to understand much less answer
and yet he be in the right !
he be wrong and he be right
the obvious the silly and the true have get to be defend
truism be true hold on to that !
the solid world exist he law do not change
stone be hard water be wet object unsupported fall towards the earth have center
with the feeling that he be speaking to o'brien and also that he be setting forth an important axiom he write :
freedom be the freedom to say that two plus two make four
if that be grant all else follow
from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee - real coffee not victory coffee - came floating out into the street
winston pause involuntarily
for perhaps two second he be back in the half-forget world of he childhood
then a door bang seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though he have be a sound
he have walk several kilometre over pavement and he varicose ulcer be throb
this be the second time in three week that he have miss an evening at the community center : a rash act since he could be certain that the number of he attendance at the center be carefully checked
in principle a party member have no spare time and be never alone except in bed
he be assumed that when he be not working eating or sleep he would be taking part in some kind of communal re-creation : to do anything that suggest a taste for solitude even to go for a walk by himself be always slightly dangerous
there be a word for he in newspeak : ownlife he be call meaning individualism and eccentricity
but this evening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air have tempt he
the sky be a warmer blue than he have see he that year and suddenly the long noisy evening at the center the boring exhaust game the lecture the creak camaraderie oil by gin have seem intolerable
on impulse he have turn away from the bus-stop and wander off into the labyrinth of london first south then east then north again losing himself amongst unknown street and hardly bother in which direction he be going
if there be hope he have write in the diary he lie in the prole
the word keep coming back to he statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity
he be somewhere in the vague brown-colored slum to the north and east of what have once be saint pancras station
he be walking up a cobble street of little two-storey house with batter doorway which give straight on the pavement and which be somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes
there be puddle of filthy water here and there amongst the cobbles
in and out of the dark doorway and down narrow alley-way that branch off on either side people swarm in astonishing number - girl in full bloom with crudely lipsticked mouth and youth who chase the girl and swell waddle woman who show he what the girl would be like in ten year ' time and old bent creature shuffle along on splay foot and ragged barefooted child who play in the puddle and then scatter at angry yell from he mother
perhaps a quarter of the window in the street be break and board up
most of the people pay no attention to winston ; a few eyed he with a sort of guarded curiosity
two monstrous woman with brick-red forearm fold across he apron be talk outside a doorway
winston catch scrap of conversation as he approach
yes i say to 'er that have all very well i say
but if he have of be in he place he have of done the same as what i done
he have easy to criticize i say but he be get the same problem as what i get
ah say the other that have jest he
that have jest where he be
the strident voice stopped abruptly
the woman studied he in hostile silence as he go past
but he be not hostility exactly ; merely a kind of wariness a momentary stiffen as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal
the blue overall of the party could not be a common sight in a street like this
indeed he be unwise to be see in such place unless he have definite business there
the patrol might stop he if he happen to run into them
may i see he paper comrade ?
what be he doing here ?
what time do he leave work ?
be this he usual way home ?
- and so on and so forth
not that there be any rule against walking home by an unusual route : but he be enough to draw attention to he if the think police hear about he
suddenly the whole street be in commotion
there be yell of warning from all side
people be shoot into the doorway like rabbit
a young woman leap out of a doorway a little ahead of winston grab up a tiny child play in a puddle whip he apron round he and leap back again all in one movement
at the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit who have emerge from a side alley run towards winston pointing excitedly to the sky
steamer ! he yell
look out guv !
bang over'ead !
lay down quick !
steamer be a nickname which for some reason the prole applied to rocket bomb
winston promptly fling himself on he face
the prole be nearly always right when he give he a warning of this kind
he seem to possess some kind of instinct which tell them several second in advance when a rocket be coming although the rocket supposedly travelled faster than sound
winston clasp he forearm above he head
there be a roar that seem to make the pavement heave ; a shower of light object patter on to he back
when he stand up he found that he be cover with fragment of glass from the near window
he walk on
the bomb have demolish a group of house 200 metre up the street
a black plume of smoke hang in the sky and below he a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd be already form around the ruin
there be a little pile of plaster lie on the pavement ahead of he and in the middle of he he could see a bright red streak
when he get up to he he saw that he be a human hand sever at the wrist
apart from the bloody stump the hand be so completely whiten as to resemble a plaster cast
he kick the thing into the gutter and then to avoid the crowd turn down a side-street to the right
within three or four minutes he be out of the area which the bomb have affected and the sordid swarm life of the street be going on as though nothing have happen
he be nearly twenty hours and the drink-shop which the prole frequent ( pub he call them ) be choke with customer
from he grimy swing door endlessly opening and shut there came forth a smell of urine sawdust and sour beer
in an angle form by a project house-front three man be standing very close together the middle one of them holding a fold-up newspaper which the other two be study over he shoulder
even before he be near enough to make out the expression on he face winston could see absorptance in every line of he body
he be obviously some serious piece of news that he be reading
he be a few pace away from them when suddenly the group break up and two of the man be in violent altercation
for a moment he seem almost on the point of blow
can he bleed well listen to what i say ?
i tell he no number ending in seven be win for over fourteen month !
yes he ' as then !
no he ' as not !
back 'ome i get the 'ole lot of 'em for over two year write down on a piece of paper
i take 'em down reg'lar as the clock
and i tell he no number ending in seven -
yes a seven 'as win !
i could pretty near tell he the bleed number
four oh seven he end in
he be in february - second week in february
february he grandmother !
i get he all down in black and white
and i tell he no number -
oh pack he in ! say the third man
he be talk about the lottery
winston look back when he have go thirty metre
he be still argue with vivid passionate face
the lottery with he weekly pay-out of enormous prise be the one public event to which the prole pay serious attention
he be probable that there be some million of prole for who the lottery be the principal if not the only reason for remain alive
he be he delight he folly he anodyne he intellectual stimulant
where the lottery be concerned even people who could barely read and write seem capable of intricate calculation and stagger feat of memory
there be a whole tribe of man who make a living simply by selling system forecast and lucky amulet
winston have nothing to do with the running of the lottery which be manage by the ministry of plenty but he be aware ( indeed everyone in the party be aware ) that the prise be largely imaginary
only small sum be actually pay out the winner of the big prise be non-existent person
in the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of oceania and another this be not difficult to arrange
but if there be hope he lay in the prole
he have to cling on to that
when he put he in word he sound reasonable : he be when he look at the human being passing he on the pavement that he become an act of faith
the street into which he have turn run downhill
he have a feeling that he have be in this neighbourhood before and that there be a main thoroughfare not far away
from somewhere ahead there came a din of shout voice
the street take a sharp turn and then end in a flight of step which lead down into a sink alley where a few stallkeepers be selling tire-look vegetable
at this moment winston remember where he be
the alley lead out into the main street and down the next turning not five minutes away be the junk-shop where he have buy the blank book which be now he diary
and in a small stationer have shop not far away he have buy he penholder and he bottle of ink
he pause for a moment at the top of the step
on the opposite side of the alley there be a dingy little pub who window appear to be frosted over but in reality be merely coated with dust
a very old man bent but active with white moustache that bristle forward like those of a prawn pushed open the swing door and go in
as winston stand watch he occur to he that the old man who musth be eighty at the least have already be middle-aged when the revolution happen
he and a few other like he be the last links that now exist with the vanish world of capitalism
in the party himself there be not many people left who idea have be form before the revolution
the old generation have mostly be wipe out in the great purge of the fifty and sixty and the few who survive have long ago be terrify into complete intellectual surrender
if there be any one still alive who could give he a truthful account of condition in the early part of the century he could only be a prole
suddenly the passage from the history book that he have copy into he diary came back into winston have mind and a lunatic impulse take hold of he
he would go into the pub he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question he
he would say to he : tell he about he life when he be a boy
what be he like in those days ?
be thing good than he be now or be he bad ?
hurriedly lest he should have time to become frighten he descend the step and cross the narrow street
he be madness of course
as usual there be no definite rule against talk to prole and frequent he pub but he be far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed
if the patrol appear he might plead an attack of faintness but he be not likely that he would believe he
he pushed open the door and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit he in the face
as he enter the din of voice drop to about half he volume
behind he back he could feel everyone eyeing he blue overall
a game of darts which be going on at the other end of the room interrupted himself for perhaps as much as thirty second
the old man who he have follow be standing at the bar have some kind of altercation with the barman a large stout hook-nosed young man with enormous forearm
a knot of other standing round with glasses in he hands be watch the scene
i arst he civil enough do i ?
say the old man straighten he shoulder pugnaciously
he telling he he be get a pint mug in the 'ole bleed boozer ?
and what in hell have name be a pint ?
say the barman leaning forward with the tip of he finger on the counter
ark at 'im !
call 'isself a barman and do know what a pint be !
why a pint have the 'alf of a quart and there have four quart to the gallon
'ave to teach he the a b c next
never hear of 'em say the barman shortly
litre and half litre - that have all he serve
there have the glasses on the shelf in front of he
i like a pint persist the old man
he could 'a drawed he off a pint easy enough
he do 'ave these bleed litre when i be a young man
when he be a young man he be all living in the treetops say the barman with a glance at the other customer
there be a shout of laughter and the uneasiness cause by winston have entry seem to disappear
the old man have whitestubbled face have flush pink
he turn away mutter to himself and bump into winston
winston catch he gently by the arm
may i offer he a drink ?
he say
he be a gent say the other straighten he shoulder again
he appear not to have notice winston have blue overall
pint ! he add aggressively to the barman
pint of wallop
the barman swish two half-litre of dark-brown beer into thick glasses which he have rinse in a bucket under the counter
beer be the only drink he could get in prole pub
the prole be supposed not to drink gin though in practice he could get hold of he easily enough
the game of darts be in full swing again and the knot of man at the bar have begin talk about lottery ticket
winston have presence be forget for a moment
there be a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of be overhear
he be horribly dangerous but at any rate there be no telescreen in the room a point he have make sure of as soon as he came in
'e could 'a drawed he off a pint grumble the old man as he settle down behind a glass
a 'alf litre be enough
he do satisfy
and a 'ole litre have too much
he start he bladder running
let alone the price
he musth have see great change since he be a young man say winston tentatively
the old man have pale blue eyes move from the darts board to the bar and from the bar to the door of the gents as though he be in the bar-room that he expect the change to have occur
the beer be good he say finally
and cheap !
when i be a young man mild beer - wallop he used to call he - be fourpence a pint
that be before the war of course
which war be that ?
say winston
he have all war say the old man vaguely
he take up he glass and he shoulder straighten again
'ere have wish he the very good of 'ealth !
in he lean throat the sharp-pointed adam have apple make a surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement and the beer vanish
winston go to the bar and came back with two more half-litre
the old man appear to have forget he prejudice against drink a full litre
he be very much old than i be say winston
he musth have be a grown man before i be born
he can remember what he be like in the old days before the revolution
people of he age do really know anything about those time
he can only read about them in book and what he say in the book may not be true
i should like he opinion on that
the history book say that life before the revolution be completely different from what he be now
there be the most terrible oppression injustice poverty bad than anything he can imagine
here in london the great mass of the people never have enough to eat from birth to death
half of them hadn't even boots on he foot
he worked twelve hours a day he left school at nine he sleep ten in a room
and at the same time there be a very few people only a few thousand - the capitalist he be call - who be rich and powerful
he own everything that there be to own
he live in great gorgeous house with thirty servant he ride about in motor-car and four-horse carriage he drink champagne he wear top hat -
the old man brighten suddenly
top 'ats ! he say
funny he should mention 'em
the same thing come into he 'ead only yesterday i dono why
i be jest thinking i be see a top 'at in year
gorn right out he 'ave
the last time i wear one be at he sister-in-law have funeral
and that be - well i could give he the date but he musth 'a be fifty year ago
of course he be only 'ired for the occasion he understand
he be very important about the top hat say winston patiently
the point be these capitalist - he and a few lawyer and priest and so forth who live on them - be the lord of the earth
everything exist for he benefit
he - the ordinary people the worker - be he slave
he could do what he like with he
he could ship he off to canada like cattle
he could sleep with he daughter if he chose
he could order he to be flog with something call a cat-o'-nine tails
he have to take he cap off when he pass them
every capitalist go about with a gangue of lackey who -
the old man brighten again
lackey ! he say
now there have a word i be 'eard since ever so long
lackey !
that reg'lar take he back that do
i recollect oh donkey have year ago - i used to sometimes go to 'yde_park of a sunday afternoon to 'ear the bloke making speech
salvation army roman catholics jews indians - all sort there be
and there be one bloke - well i could give he 'is name but a real powerful speaker 'e be
'e do 'alf give he 'em !
lackey ! 'e say lackey of the bourgeoisie !
flunky of the ruling class !
parasite - that be another of them
and 'yenas - 'e definitely call 'em 'yenas
of course 'e be refer to the labor party he understand
winston have the feeling that he be talk at cross-purpose
what i really want to know be this he say
do he feel that he have more freedom now than he have in those days ?
be he treat more like a human be ?
in the old days the rich people the people at the top -
the 'ouse of lord put in the old man reminiscently
the house of lord if he like
what i be ask be be these people able to treat he as an inferior simply because he be rich and he be poor ?
be he a fact for instance that he have to call them sir and take off he cap when he pass them ?
the old man appear to think deeply
he drink off about a quarter of he beer before answer
yes he say
he like he to touch he cap to 'em
he show respect like
i do agree with he himself but i done he often enough
have to as he might say
and be he usual - i be only quote what i have read in history book - be he usual for these people and he servant to push he off the pavement into the gutter ?
one of 'em pushed he once say the old man
i recollect he as if he be yesterday
he be boat race night - terribly rowdy he used to get on boat race night - and i bump into a young bloke on shaftesbury avenue
quite a gent 'e be - diving shirt top 'at black overcoat
'e be kind of zig across the pavement and i bump into 'im accidental-like
'e say why can he look where he be going ?
'e say
i say ju think he have buy the bleed pavement ?
'e say i will twist he bloody 'ead off if he get fresh with he
i say he be drunk
i will give he in charge in 'alf a minute i say
and if he will believe he 'e put 'is 'and on he chest and give he a shove as pretty near send he under the wheels of a bus
well i be young in them days and i be going to 'ave fetch 'im one only -
a sense of helplessness take hold of winston
the old man have memory be nothing but a rubbish-heap of detail
one could question he all day without get any real information
the party history might still be true after a fashion : he might even be completely true
he make a last attempt
perhaps i have not make himself clear he say
what i be trying to say be this
he have be alive a very long time ; he live half he life before the revolution
in 1925 for instance he be already grown up
would he say from what he can remember that life in 1925 be good than he be now or bad ?
if he could choose would he prefer to live then or now ?
the old man look meditatively at the darts board
he finished up he beer more slowly than before
when he spoke he be with a tolerant philosophical air as though the beer have mellow he
i know what he expect he to say he say
he expect he to say as i have sooner be young again
most people have say he have sooner be young if he arst ' 'em
he get he 'ealth and strength when he be young
when he get to he time of life he be never well
i suffer something wicked from he foot and he bladder have jest terrible
six and seven time a night he 'as he out of bed
on the other 'and there have great advantage in be a old man
he be get the same worry
no truck with woman and that have a great thing
i be 'ad a woman for near on thirty year if he have credit he
nor want to what have more
winston sit back against the window-sill
he be no use going on
he be about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly get up and shuffle rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room
the extra half-litre be already working on he
winston sit for a minute or two gaze at he empty glass and hardly notice when he foot carry he out into the street again
within twenty year at the most he reflect the huge and simple question be life good before the revolution than he be now ?
would have cease once and for all to be answerable
but in effect he be unanswerable even now since the few scatter survivor from the ancient world be incapable of compare one age with another
he remember a million useless thing a quarrel with a workmate a hunt for a lose bicycle pump the expression on a long-dead sister have face the swirl of dust on a windy morning seventy year ago : but all the relevant facts be outside the range of he vision
he be like the ant which can see small object but not large one
and when memory fail and write record be falsify - when that happen the claim of the party to have improve the condition of human life have get to be accepted because there do not exist and never again could exist any standard against which he could be test
at this moment he train of think stopped abruptly
he halt and look up
he be in a narrow street with a few dark little shop intersperse amongst dwelling-house
immediately above he head there hang three discolour metal balls which look as if he have once be gild
he seem to know the place
of course !
he be standing outside the junk-shop where he have buy the diary
a twinge of fear go through he
he have be a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning and he have sworn never to come near the place again
and yet the instant that he allow he thought to wander he foot have bring he back here of he own accord
he be precisely against suicidal impulse of this kind that he have hope to guard himself by opening the diary
at the same time he notice that although he be nearly twenty-one hours the shop be still open
with the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement he step through the doorway
if question he could plausibly say that he be trying to buy razor blade
the proprietor have just light a hanging oil lamp which give off an unclean but friendly smell
he be a man of perhaps sixty frail and bow with a long benevolent nose and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles
he hair be almost white but he eyebrow be bushy and still black
he spectacles he gentle fussy movement and the fact that he be wearing an aged jacket of black velvet give he a vague air of intellectuality as though he have be some kind of literary man or perhaps a musician
he voice be soft as though fade and he accent less debase than that of the majority of prole
i recognize he on the pavement he say immediately
he be the gentleman that buy the young lady have keepsake album
that be a beautiful bit of paper that be
cream-lay he used to be call
there have be no paper like that make for - oh i dare say fifty year
he peer at winston over the top of he spectacles
be there anything special i can do for he ?
or do he just want to look round ?
i be passing say winston vaguely
i just look in
i do want anything in particular
he have just as well say the other because i do suppose i could have satisfy he
he make an apologetic gesture with he softpalmed hand
he see how he be ; an empty shop he might say
between he and he the antique trade have just about finished
no demand any longer and no stock either
furniture china glass he have all be break up by degree
and of course the metal stuff have mostly be melt down
i have see a brass candlestick in year
the tiny interior of the shop be in fact uncomfortably full but there be almost nothing in he of the slight value
the floorspace be very restricted because all round the wall be stacked innumerable dusty picture-frame
in the window there be tray of nuts and bolt worn-out chisel penknife with break blade tarnish watch that do not even pretend to be in going order and other miscellaneous rubbish
only on a small table in the corner be there a litter of odds and end - lacquer snuff-box agate brooch and the like - which look as though he might include something interesting
as winston wander towards the table he eye be catch by a round smooth thing that gleam softly in the lamplight and he pick he up
he be a heavy lump of glass curve on one side flat on the other making almost a hemisphere
there be a peculiar softness as of rainwater in both the colour and the texture of the glass
at the heart of he magnify by the curve surface there be a strange pink convoluted object that recall a rose or a sea anemone
what be he ?
say winston fascinate
that have coral that be say the old man
he musth have come from the indian ocean
he used to kind of embed he in the glass
that wasn't make less than a hundred year ago
more by the look of he
he have a beautiful thing say winston
he be a beautiful thing say the other appreciatively
but there have not many that have say so nowadays
he cough
now if he so happen that he want to buy he that have cost he four dollar
i can remember when a thing like that would have fetch eight pound and eight pound be - well i can work he out but he be a lot of money
but who care about genuine antique nowadays even the few that have left ?
winston immediately pay over the four dollar and slide the covet thing into he pocket
what appeal to he about he be not so much he beauty as the air he seem to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one
the soft rainwatery glass be not like any glass that he have ever see
the thing be doubly attractive because of he apparent uselessness though he could guess that he musth once have be intended as a paper-weight
he be very heavy in he pocket but fortunately he do not make much of a bulge
he be a queer thing even a compromise thing for a party member to have in he possession
anything old and for that matter anything beautiful be always vaguely suspect
the old man have grown noticeably more cheerful after receive the four dollar
winston realize that he would have accepted three or even two
there have another room upstairs that he might care to take a look at he say
there have not much in he
just a few piece
he will do with a light if he be going upstairs
he light another lamp and with bow back lead the way slowly up the steep and wear stairs and along a tiny passage into a room which do not give on the street but look out on a cobble yard and a forest of chimney-pot
winston notice that the furniture be still arrange as though the room be mean to be live in
there be a strip of carpet on the floor a picture or two on the wall and a deep slatternly arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace
an old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face be ticking away on the mantelpiece
under the window and occupy nearly a quarter of the room be an enormous bed with the mattress still on he
he live here till he wife die say the old man half apologetically
i be selling the furniture off by little and little
now that have a beautiful mahogany bed or at least he would be if he could get the bug out of he
but i dare say he have find he a little bit cumbersome
he be holding the lamp high up so as to illuminate the whole room and in the warm dim light the place look curiously inviting
the think flit through winston have mind that he would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollar a week if he dare to take the risk
he be a wild impossible notion to be abandoned as soon as think of ; but the room have awaken in he a sort of nostalgia a sort of ancestral memory
he seem to he that he know exactly what he feel like to sit in a room like this in an arm-chair beside an open fire with he foot in the fender and a kettle on the hob ; utterly alone utterly secure with nobody watch he no voice pursue he no sound except the sing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock
there have no telescreen ! he could not help murmur
ah say the old man i never have one of those thing
too expensive
and i never seem to feel the need of he somehow
now that have a nice gateleg table in the corner there
though of course he have have to put new hinge on he if he want to use the flap
there be a small bookcase in the other corner and winston have already gravitate towards he
he contain nothing but rubbish
the hunting-down and destruction of book have be done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else
he be very unlikely that there exist anywhere in oceania a copy of a book print earlier than 1960
the old man still carry the lamp be standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hang on the other side of the fireplace opposite the bed
now if he happen to be interested in old print at all - he begin delicately
winston came across to examine the picture
he be a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular window and a small tower in front
there be a railing running round the building and at the rear end there be what appear to be a statue
winston gaze at he for some moment
he seem vaguely familiar though he do not remember the statue
the frame have fixed to the wall say the old man but i could unscrew he for he i dare say
i know that building say winston finally
he have a ruin now
he have in the middle of the street outside the palace of justice
that have right
outside the law court
he be bomb in - oh many year ago
he be a church at one time st clement danes he name be
he smile apologetically as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous and add : orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have !
what have that ?
say winston
oh - orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
that be a rhyme he have when i be a little boy
how he go on i do remember but i do know he end up here come a candle to light he to bed here come a chopper to chop off he head
he be a kind of a dance
he hold out he arms for he to pass under and when he came to here come a chopper to chop off he head he bring he arms down and catch he
he be just name of church
all the london church be in he - all the principal one that be
winston wonder vaguely to what century the church belong
he be always difficult to determine the age of a london building
anything large and impressive if he be reasonably new in appearance be automatically claim as have be build since the revolution while anything that be obviously of earlier date be ascribe to some dim period call the middle age
the century of capitalism be hold to have produce nothing of any value
one could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn he from book
statue inscription memorial stone the name of street - anything that might throw light upon the past have be systematically alter
i never know he have be a church he say
there have a lot of them left really say the old man though he have be put to other use
now how do that rhyme go ?
ah !
i have get he !
orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
he owe he three farthing say the bell of st martin have -
there now that have as far as i can get
a farthing that be a small copper coin look something like a cent
where be st martin have ?
say winston
st martin have ?
that have still standing
he have in victory square alongside the picture gallery
a building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillar in front and a big flight of step
winston know the place well
he be a museum used for propaganda display of various kind - scale model of rocket bomb and floating fortress waxwork tableau illustrate enemy atrocity and the like
st martin's-in-the-field he used to be call supplement the old man though i do recollect any field anywhere in those parts
winston do not buy the picture
he would have be an even more incongruous possession than the glass paper-weight and impossible to carry home unless he be take out of he frame
but he linger for some minutes more talk to the old man who name he discover be not week - as one might have gather from the inscription over the shop-front - but charrington
mr charrington he seem be a widower aged sixty-three and have inhabit this shop for thirty year
throughout that time he have be intend to alter the name over the window but have never quite get to the point of doing he
all the while that he be talk the half-remember rhyme keep running through winston have head
orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have he owe he three farthing say the bell of st martin have !
he be curious but when he say he to himself he have the illusion of actually hearing bell the bell of a lose london that still exist somewhere or other disguised and forget
from one ghostly steeple after another he seem to hear them peal forth
yet so far as he could remember he have never in real life hear church bell ring
he get away from mr charrington and go down the stairs alone so as not to let the old man see he reconnoitre the street before step out of the door
he have already make up he mind that after a suitable interval - a month say - he would take the risk of visit the shop again
he be perhaps not more dangerous than shirk an evening at the center
the serious piece of folly have be to come back here in the first place after buy the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trust
however - !
yes he think again he would come back
he would buy further scrap of beautiful rubbish
he would buy the engraving of st clement danes take he out of he frame and carry he home conceal under the jacket of he overall
he would drag the rest of that poem out of mr charrington have memory
even the lunatic project of rent the room upstairs flash momentarily through he mind again
for perhaps five second exaltation make he careless and he step out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window
he have even start hum to an improvise tune
orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
he owe he three farthing say the
suddenly he heart seem to turn to ice and he bowel to water
a figure in blue overall be coming down the pavement not ten metre away
he be the girl from the fiction department the girl with dark hair
the light be failing but there be no difficulty in recognize he
he look he straight in the face then walk quickly on as though he have not see he
for a few second winston be too paralyse to move
then he turn to the right and walk heavily away not notice for the moment that he be going in the wrong direction
at any rate one question be settle
there be no doubt any longer that the girl be spy on he
he musth have follow he here because he be not credible that by pure chance he should have happen to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet kilometre distant from any quarter where party member live
he be too great a coincidence
whether he be really an agent of the think police or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness hardly matter
he be enough that he be watch he
probably he have see he go into the pub as well
he be an effort to walk
the lump of glass in he pocket bang against he thigh at each step and he be half minded to take he out and throw he away
the bad thing be the pain in he belly
for a couple of minutes he have the feeling that he would die if he do not reach a lavatory soon
but there would be no public lavatory in a quarter like this
then the spasm pass leave a dull ache behind
the street be a blind alley
winston halt stand for several second wonder vaguely what to do then turn round and begin to re-trace he step
as he turn he occur to he that the girl have only pass he three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with he
he could keep on he track till he be in some quiet place and then smash he skull in with a cobble-stone
the piece of glass in he pocket would be heavy enough for the job
but he abandoned the idea immediately because even the think of making any physical effort be unbearable
he could not run he could not strike a blow
besides he be young and lusty and would defend himself
he think also of hurry to the community center and stay there till the place closed so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening
but that too be impossible
a deadly lassitude have take hold of he
all he want be to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet
he be after twenty-two hours when he get back to the flat
the lights would be switch off at the main at twenty-three thirty
he go into the kitchen and swallow nearly a teacupful of victory gin
then he go to the table in the alcove sit down and take the diary out of the drawer
but he do not open he at once
from the telescreen a brassie female voice be squall a patriotic song
he sit stare at the marbled cover of the book trying without success to shut the voice out of he consciousness
he be at night that he came for he always at night
the proper thing be to kill himself before he get he
undoubtedly some people do so
many of the disappearance be actually suicide
but he need desperate courage to kill himself in a world where fire-arm or any quick and certain poison be completely unprocurable
he think with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear the treachery of the human body which always freeze into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort be need
he might have silence the dark girl if only he have act quickly enough : but precisely because of the extremity of he danger he have lose the power to act
he strike he that in moment of crisis one be never fight against an external enemy but always against one have own body
even now in spite of the gin the dull ache in he belly make consecutive think impossible
and he be the same he perceive in all seemingly heroic or tragic situation
on the battlefield in the torture chamber on a sinking ship the issue that he be fight for be always forget because the body swell up until he fill the universe and even when he be not paralyse by fright or scream with pain life be a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness against a sour stomach or an ache tooth
he open the diary
he be important to write something down
the woman on the telescreen have start a new song
he voice seem to stick into he brain like jagged splinter of glass
he try to think of o'brien for who or to who the diary be write but instead he begin thinking of the thing that would happen to he after the think police take he away
he would not matter if he kill he at once
to be kill be what he expect
but before death ( nobody spoke of such thing yet everybody know of them ) there be the routine of confession that have to be go through : the grovel on the floor and scream for mercy the crack of break bone the smashed tooth and bloody clot of hair
why do he have to endure he since the end be always the same ?
why be he not possible to cut a few days or week out of he life ?
nobody ever escape detection and nobody ever fail to confess
when once he have succumb to thoughtcrime he be certain that by a give date he would be dead
why then do that horror which alter nothing have to lie embed in future time ?
he try with a little more success than before to summon up the image of o'brien
he shall meet in the place where there be no darkness o'brien have say to he
he know what he mean or think he know
the place where there be no darkness be the imagine future which one would never see but which by foreknowledge one could mystically share in
but with the voice from the telescreen nag at he ear he could not follow the train of think further
he put a cigarette in he mouth
half the tobacco promptly fell out on to he tongue a bitter dust which be difficult to spit out again
the face of big brother swim into he mind displace that of o'brien
just as he have done a few days earlier he slide a coin out of he pocket and look at he
the face gaze up at he heavy calm protect : but what kind of smile be hide beneath the dark moustache ?
like a leaden knell the word came back at he : war be peace freedom be slavery ignorance be strength
he be the middle of the morning and winston have left the cubicle to go to the lavatory
a solitary figure be coming towards he from the other end of the long brightly-light corridor
he be the girl with dark hair
four days have go past since the evening when he have run into he outside the junk-shop
as he came near he saw that he right arm be in a sling not noticeable at a distance because he be of the same colour as he overall
probably he have crush he hand while swing round one of the big kaleidoscope on which the plot of novel be rough in
he be a common accident in the fiction department
he be perhaps four metre apart when the girl stumble and fell almost flat on he face
a sharp cry of pain be wring out of he
he musth have fall right on the injured arm
winston stopped short
the girl have rise to he knee
he face have turn a milky yellow colour against which he mouth stand out redder than ever
he eyes be fixed on he with an appeal expression that look more like fear than pain
a curious emotion stir in winston have heart
in front of he be an enemy who be trying to kill he : in front of he also be a human creature in pain and perhaps with a break bone
already he have instinctively start forward to help he
in the moment when he have see he fall on the bandage arm he have be as though he feel the pain in he own body
he be hurt ?
he say
he have nothing
he arm
he will be all right in a second
he spoke as though he heart be flutter
he have certainly turn very pale
he have break anything ?
no i be all right
he hurt for a moment that have all
he hold out he free hand to he and he help he up
he have regain some of he colour and appear very much good
he have nothing he repeated shortly
i only give he wrist a bit of a bang
thanks comrade !
and with that he walk on in the direction in which he have be going as briskly as though he have really be nothing
the whole incident could not have take as much as half a minute
not to let one have feeling appear in one have face be a habit that have acquire the status of an instinct and in any case he have be standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happen
nevertheless he have be very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise for in the two or three second while he be helping he up the girl have slip something into he hand
there be no question that he have done he intentionally
he be something small and flat
as he pass through the lavatory door he transfer he to he pocket and feel he with the tip of he finger
he be a scrap of paper fold into a square
while he stand at the urinal he manage with a little more fingering to get he unfold
obviously there musth be a message of some kind write on he
for a moment he be tempt to take he into one of the water-closet and read he at once
but that would be shocking folly as he well know
there be no place where he could be more certain that the telescreens be watch continuously
he go back to he cubicle sit down throw the fragment of paper casually amongst the other paper on the desk put on he spectacles and hitch the speakwrite towards he five minutes he tell himself five minutes at the very least !
he heart bump in he breast with frighten loudness
fortunately the piece of work he be engaged on be mere routine the rectification of a long list of figure not need close attention
whatever be write on the paper he musth have some kind of political meaning
so far as he could see there be two possibility
one much the more likely be that the girl be an agent of the think police just as he have fear
he do not know why the think police should choose to deliver he message in such a fashion but perhaps he have he reason
the thing that be write on the paper might be a threat a summons an order to commit suicide a traprock of some description
but there be another wilder possibility that keep raising he head though he try vainly to suppress he
this be that the message do not come from the think police at all but from some kind of underground organization
perhaps the brotherhood exist after all !
perhaps the girl be part of he !
no doubt the idea be absurd but he have spring into he mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in he hand
he be not till a couple of minutes later that the other more probable explanation have occur to he
and even now though he intellect tell he that the message probably mean death - still that be not what he believe and the unreasonable hope persist and he heart bang and he be with difficulty that he keep he voice from tremble as he murmur he figure into the speakwrite
he roll up the complete bundle of work and slide he into the pneumatic tube
eight minutes have go by
he re-adjust he spectacles on he nose sigh and draw the next batch of work towards he with the scrap of paper on top of he
he flatten he out
on he be write in a large unformed handwriting : i love he
for several second he be too stun even to throw the incriminate thing into the memory hole
when he do so although he know very well the danger of showing too much interest he could not resist reading he once again just to make sure that the word be really there
for the rest of the morning he be very difficult to work
what be even bad than have to focus he mind on a series of niggling job be the need to conceal he agitation from the telescreen
he feel as though a fire be burning in he belly
lunch in the hot crowded noise-fill canteen be torment
he have hope to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour but as bad luck would have he the imbecile parson flop down beside he the tang of he sweat almost defeat the tinny smell of stew and keep up a stream of talk about the preparation for hate week
he be particularly enthusiastic about a papier model of big brother have head two metre wide which be be make for the occasion by he daughter have troop of spy
the irritate thing be that in the racket of voice winston could hardly hear what parson be saying and be constantly have to ask for some fatuous remarque to be repeated
just once he catch a glimpse of the girl at a table with two other girl at the far end of the room
he appear not to have see he and he do not look in that direction again
the afternoon be more bearable
immediately after lunch there arrive a delicate difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitate putt everything else aside
he consist in falsify a series of production report of two year ago in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the inner party who be now under a cloud
this be the kind of thing that winston be good at and for more than two hours he succeed in shut the girl out of he mind altogether
then the memory of he face came back and with he a rage intolerable desire to be alone
until he could be alone he be impossible to think this new development out
tonight be one of he nights at the community center
he wolf another tasteless meal in the canteen hurried off to the center take part in the solemn foolery of a discussion group play two game of table tennis swallow several glasses of gin and sit for half an hour through a lecture entitle ingsoc in relation to chessman
he soul writhe with boredom but for once he have have no impulse to shirk he evening at the center
at the sight of the word i love he the desire to stay alive have well up in he and the taking of minor risk suddenly seem stupid
he be not till twenty-three hours when he be home and in bed - in the darkness where he be safe even from the telescreen so long as he keep silent - that he be able to think continuously
he be a physical problem that have to be solve : how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting
he do not consider any longer the possibility that he might be lay some kind of traprock for he
he know that he be not so because of he unmistakable agitation when he hand he the note
obviously he have be frighten out of he wits as well he might be
nor do the idea of refuse he advances even cross he mind
only five nights ago he have contemplate smashing he skull in with a cobble-stone but that be of no importance
he think of he naked youthful body as he have see he in he dream
he have imagine he a fool like all the rest of them he head stuffed with lie and hatred he belly full of ice
a kind of fever seize he at the think that he might lose he the white youthful body might slip away from he !
what he fear more than anything else be that he would simply change he mind if he do not get in touch with he quickly
but the physical difficulty of meeting be enormous
he be like trying to make a move at chessman when he be already mate
whichever way he turn the telescreen face he
actually all the possible way of communicate with he have occur to he within five minutes of reading the note ; but now with time to think he go over them one by one as though lay out a row of instrument on a table
obviously the kind of encounter that have happen this morning could not be repeated
if he have worked in the record department he might have be comparatively simple but he have only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the fiction department lay and he have no pretext for going there
if he have known where he live and at what time he left work he could have contrived to meet he somewhere on he way home ; but to try to follow he home be not safe because he would mean loiter about outside the ministry which be bound to be notice
as for scend a letter through the mail he be out of the question
by a routine that be not even secret all letters be open in transit
actually few people ever write letters
for the message that he be occasionally necessary to scend there be print postcard with long lists of phrase and he strike out the one that be inapplicable
in any case he do not know the girl have name let alone he address
finally he decided that the safe place be the canteen
if he could get he at a table by himself somewhere in the middle of the room not too near the telescreens and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round - if these condition endure for say thirty second he might be possible to exchange a few word
for a week after this life be like a restless dream
on the next day he do not appear in the canteen until he be leave he the whistle have already blow
presumably he have be change on to a later shift
he pass each other without a glance
on the day after that he be in the canteen at the usual time but with three other girl and immediately under a telescreen
then for three dreadful days he do not appear at all
he whole mind and body seem to be afflict with an unbearable sensitivity a sort of transparency which make every movement every sound every contact every word that he have to speak or listen to an agony
even in sleep he could not altogether escape from he image
he do not touch the diary during those days
if there be any relief he be in he work in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch
he have absolutely no clue as to what have happen to he
there be no enquiry he could make
he might have be vaporize he might have commit suicide he might have be transfer to the other end of oceania : bad and likely of all he might simply have change he mind and decided to avoid he
the next day he reappear
he arm be out of the sling and he have a band of sticking-plaster round he wrist
the relief of seeing he be so great that he could not resist stare directly at he for several second
on the following day he very nearly succeed in speaking to he
when he came into the canteen he be sitting at a table well out from the wall and be quite alone
he be early and the place be not very full
the queue edge forward till winston be almost at the counter then be hold up for two minutes because someone in front be complain that he have not receive he tablet of saccharine
but the girl be still alone when winston secure he tray and begin to make for he table
he walk casually towards he he eyes searching for a place at some table beyond he
he be perhaps three metre away from he
another two second would do he
then a voice behind he call smith !
he pretend not to hear
smith ! repeated the voice more loudly
he be no use
he turn round
a blond-headed silly-face young man name wilsher who he barely know be inviting he with a smile to a vacant place at he table
he be not safe to refuse
after have be recognize he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl
he be too noticeable
he sit down with a friendly smile
the silly blond face beam into he
winston have a hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of he
the girl have table fill up a few minutes later
but he musth have see he coming towards he and perhaps he would take the hint
next day he take care to arrive early
surely enough he be at a table in about the same place and again alone
the person immediately ahead of he in the queue be a small swiftly-moving beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny suspicious eyes
as winston turn away from the counter with he tray he saw that the little man be making straight for the girl have table
he hope sink again
there be a vacant place at a table further away but something in the little man have appearance suggest that he would be sufficiently attentive to he own comfort to choose the empty table
with ice at he heart winston follow
he be no use unless he could get the girl alone
at this moment there be a tremendous crash
the little man be sprawl on all four he tray have go flying two stream of soup and coffee be flow across the floor
he start to he foot with a malignant glance at winston who he evidently suspect of have trip he up
but he be all right
five second later with a thundering heart winston be sitting at the girl have table
he do not look at he
he unpack he tray and promptly begin eating
he be all-important to speak at once before anyone else came but now a terrible fear have take possession of he
a week have go by since he have first approach he
he would have change he mind he musth have change he mind !
he be impossible that this affair should end successfully ; such thing do not happen in real life
he might have flinch altogether from speaking if at this moment he have not see ampleforth the hairy-eared poet wandering limply round the room with a tray look for a place to sit down
in he vague way ampleforth be attached to winston and would certainly sit down at he table if he catch sight of he
there be perhaps a minute in which to act
both winston and the girl be eating steadily
the stuff he be eating be a thin stew actually a soup of haricot bean
in a low murmur winston begin speaking
neither of them look up ; steadily he spoon the watery stuff into he mouth and between spoonful exchange the few necessary word in low expressionless voice
what time do he leave work ?
eighteen-thirty
where can he meet ?
victory square near the monument
he have full of telescreens
he do matter if there have a crowd
any signal ?
no
do come up to he until he see he amongst a lot of people
and do look at he
just keep somewhere near he
what time ?
nineteen hours
all right
ampleforth fail to see winston and sit down at another table
he do not speak again and so far as he be possible for two people sitting on opposite side of the same table he do not look at one another
the girl finished he lunch quickly and make off while winston stay to smoke a cigarette
winston be in victory square before the appoint time
he wander round the base of the enormous fluted column at the top of which big brother have statue gaze southward towards the sky where he have vanquish the eurasian aeroplane ( the eastasian aeroplane he have be a few year ago ) in the battle of airstrip one
in the street in front of he there be a statue of a man on horseback which be supposed to re-present olive cromwell
at five minutes past the hour the girl have still not appear
again the terrible fear seize upon winston
he be not coming he have change he mind !
he walk slowly up to the north side of the square and get a sort of pale-colored pleasure from identify st martin have church who bell when he have bell have chime he owe he three farthing
then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument reading or pretend to read a poster which run spirally up the column
he be not safe to go near he until some more people have accumulate
there be telescreens all round the pediment
but at this moment there be a din of shout and a zoom of heavy vehicle from somewhere to the left
suddenly everyone seem to be running across the square
the girl nipped nimbly round the lion at the base of the monument and join in the rush
winston follow
as he run he gather from some shout remarque that a convoy of eurasian prisoner be passing
already a dense mass of people be block the south side of the square
winston at normal time the kind of person who gravitate to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage shove butt squirm he way forward into the heart of the crowd
soon he be within arm have length of the girl but the way be blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman presumably he wife who seem to forme an impenetrable wall of flesh
winston wriggle himself sideways and with a violent lunge manage to drive he shoulder between them
for a moment he feel as though he entrails be be ground to pulp between the two muscular hip then he have break through sweat a little
he be next to the girl
he be shoulder to shoulder both stare fixedly in front of them
a long line of truck with wooden-face guard armed with sub-machine gun standing upright in each corner be passing slowly down the street
in the truck little yellow man in shabby greenish uniform be squat jam close together
he sad mongolism face gaze out over the side of the truck utterly incurious
occasionally when a truck jolt there be a clankclank of metal : all the prisoner be wearing leg-irons
truckload after truck-load of the sad face pass
winston know he be there but he saw them only intermittently
the girl have shoulder and he arm right down to the elbow be press against he
he cheek be almost near enough for he to feel he warmth
he have immediately take charge of the situation just as he have done in the canteen
he begin speaking in the same expressionless voice as before with lip barely moving a mere murmur easily drown by the din of voice and the rumble of the truck
can he hear he ?
yes
can he get sunday afternoon off ?
yes
then listen carefully
he will have to remember this
go to paddington station -
with a sort of military precision that astonish he he outline the route that he be to follow
a half-hour railway journey ; turn left outside the station ; two kilometre along the road : a gate with the top bar missing ; a path across a field ; a grass-grown lane ; a track between bush ; a dead tree with moss on he
he be as though he have a map inside he head
can he remember all that ?
he murmur finally
yes
he turn left then right then left again
and the gate have get no top bar
yes
what time ?
about fifteen
he may have to wait
i will get there by another way
be he sure he remember everything ?
yes
then get away from he as quick as he can
he need not have tell he that
but for the moment he could not extricate himself from the crowd
the truck be still file post the people still insatiably gape
at the start there have be a few boo and hiss but he came only from the party member amongst the crowd and have soon stopped
the prevailing emotion be simply curiosity
foreigner whether from eurasia or from eastasia be a kind of strange animal
one literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoner and even as prisoner one never get more than a momentary glimpse of them
nor do one know what become of them apart from the few who be hang as war-criminal : the other simply vanish presumably into forced-labor camp
the round mongol face have give way to face of a more european type dirty bearded and exhaust
from over scrubby cheekbone eyes look into winston have sometimes with strange intensity and flash away again
the convoy be drawing to an end
in the last truck he could see an aged man he face a mass of grizzled hair standing upright with wrist cross in front of he as though he be used to have them bound together
he be almost time for winston and the girl to part
but at the last moment while the crowd still hem them in he hand feel for he and give he a fleeting squeeze
he could not have be ten second and yet he seem a long time that he hands be clasp together
he have time to learn every detail of he hand
he explore the long finger the shapely nail the work-harden palm with he row of callous the smooth flesh under the wrist
merely from feeling he he would have known he by sight
in the same instant he occur to he that he do not know what colour the girl have eyes be
he be probably brown but people with dark hair sometimes have blue eyes
to turn he head and look at he would have be inconceivable folly
with hands lock together invisible amongst the press of body he stare steadily in front of them and instead of the eyes of the girl the eyes of the aged prisoner gaze mournfully at winston out of nest of hair
winston pick he way up the lane through dapple light and shade step out into pools of gold wherever the bough parted
under the tree to the left of he the ground be misty with bluebell
the air seem to kiss one have skin
he be the second of may
from somewhere deep in the heart of the wood came the drone of ring dove
he be a bit early
there have be no difficulty about the journey and the girl be so evidently experienced that he be less frighten than he would normally have be
presumably he could be trust to find a safe place
in general he could not assume that he be much safe in the country than in london
there be no telescreens of course but there be always the danger of conceal microphone by which he voice might be pick up and recognize ; besides he be not easy to make a journey by himself without attract attention
for distance of less than 100 kilometre he be not necessary to get he passport endorse but sometimes there be patrol hanging about the railway station who examine the paper of any party member he found there and ask awkward question
however no patrol have appear and on the walk from the station he have make sure by cautious backward glance that he be not be follow
the train be full of prole in holiday mood because of the summery weather
the wooden-seat carriage in which he travelled be fill to overflow by a single enormous family ranging from a toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby going out to spend an afternoon with in-law in the country and as he freely explain to winston to get hold of a little black-market butter
the lane widen and in a minute he came to the footpath he have tell he of a mere cattle-track which plunge between the bush
he have no watch but he could not be fifteen yet
the bluebell be so thick underfoot that he be impossible not to tread on them
he kneel down and begin pick some partly to pass the time away but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flower to offer to the girl when he meet
he have get together a big bunch and be smell he faint sickly scent when a sound at he back freeze he the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twig
he go on pick bluebell
he be the good thing to do
he might be the girl or he might have be follow after all
to look round be to show guilt
he pick another and another
a hand fell lightly on he shoulder
he look up
he be the girl
he shake he head evidently as a warning that he musth keep silent then parted the bush and quickly lead the way along the narrow track into the wood
obviously he have be that way before for he dodge the boggy bit as though by habit
winston follow still clasp he bunch of flower
he first feeling be relief but as he watch the strong slender body moving in front of he with the scarlet sash that be just tight enough to bring out the curve of he hip the sense of he own inferiority be heavy upon he
even now he seem quite likely that when he turn round and look at he he would draw back after all
the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leave daunt he
already on the walk from the station the may sunshine have make he feel dirty and etiolate a creature of indoors with the sooty dust of london in the pore of he skin
he occur to he that till now he have probably never see he in broad daylight in the open
he came to the fall tree that he have speak of
the girl hop over and forced apart the bush in which there do not seem to be an opening
when winston follow he he found that he be in a natural clearing a tiny grassy knell surround by tall sapling that shut he in completely
the girl stopped and turn
here he be he say
he be facing he at several pace ' distance
as yet he do not dare move near to he
i do want to say anything in the lane he go on in case there have a mike hide there
i do suppose there be but there could be
there have always the chance of one of those swine recognize he voice
he be all right here
he still have not the courage to approach he
he be all right here ?
he repeated stupidly
yes
look at the tree
he be small ashes which at some time have be cut down and have sprout up again into a forest of pole none of them thick than one have wrist
there have nothing big enough to hide a mike in
besides i have be here before
he be only making conversation
he have manage to move closer to he now
he stand before he very upright with a smile on he face that look faintly ironic as though he be wonder why he be so slow to act
the bluebell have cascade on to the ground
he seem to have fall of he own accord
he take he hand
would he believe he say that till this moment i do know what colour he eyes be ?
he be brown he noted a rather light shade of brown with dark lash
now that he have see what i be really like can he still bear to look at he ?
yes easily
i be thirty-nine year old
i have get a wife that i can get rid of
i have get varicose vein
i have get five false tooth
i could care less say the girl
the next moment he be hard to say by who act he be in he he arms
at the beginning he have no feeling except sheer incredulity
the youthful body be strained against he own the mass of dark hair be against he face and yes ! actually he have turn he face up and he be kissing the wide red mouth
he have clasp he arms about he neck he be calling he darling precious one love one
he have pull he down on to the ground he be utterly unresisting he could do what he like with he
but the truth be that he have no physical sensation except that of mere contact
all he feel be incredulity and pride
he be glad that this be happening but he have no physical desire
he be too soon he youth and prettiness have frighten he he be too much used to living without woman - he do not know the reason
the girl pick himself up and pull a bluebell out of he hair
he sit against he putt he arm round he waist
never mind dear
there have no hurry
he have get the whole afternoon
be this a splendid hide-out ?
i found he when i get lose once on a community hike
if anyone be coming he could hear them a hundred metre away
what be he name ?
say winston
julia
i know he
he have winston - winston smith
how do he find that out ?
i expect i be good at finding thing out than he be dear
tell he what do he think of he before that day i give he the note ?
he do not feel any temptation to tell lie to he
he be even a sort of love-offering to start off by telling the bad
i hate the sight of he he say
i want to rape he and then murder he afterward
two week ago i think seriously of smashing he head in with a cobble-stone
if he really want to know i imagine that he have something to do with the think police
the girl laugh delightedly evidently taking this as a tribute to the excellence of he disguise
not the think police !
he do honestly think that ?
well perhaps not exactly that
but from he general appearance - merely because he be young and fresh and healthy he understand - i think that probably -
he think i be a good party member
pure in word and deed
banner procession slogan game community hike all that stuff
and he think that if i have a quarter of a chance i have denounce he as a think-criminal and get he kill off ?
yes something of that kind
a great many young girl be like that he know
he have this bloody thing that do he he say ripping off the scarlet sash of the junior anti-sex league and fling he on to a bough
then as though touching he waist have remind he of something he feel in the pocket of he overall and produce a small slab of chocolate
he break he in half and give one of the piece to winston
even before he have take he he know by the smell that he be very unusual chocolate
he be dark and shiny and be wrapped in silver paper
chocolate normally be dullbrown crumbly stuff that taste as nearly as one could describe he like the smoke of a rubbish fire
but at some time or another he have taste chocolate like the piece he have give he
the first whiff of he scent have stir up some memory which he could not pin down but which be powerful and trouble
where do he get this stuff ?
he say
black market he say indifferently
actually i be that sort of girl to look at
i be good at game
i be a troop-leader in the spy
i do voluntary work three evenings a week for the junior anti-sex league
hours and hours i have spend past he bloody rot all over london
i always carry one end of a banner in the procession
i always look cheerful and i never shirk anything
always yell with the crowd that have what i say
he have the only way to be safe
the first fragment of chocolate have melt on winston have tongue
the taste be delightful
but there be still that memory moving round the edge of he consciousness something strongly feel but not reducible to definite shape like an object see out of the corner of one have eye
he pushed he away from he aware only that he be the memory of some action which he would have like to undo but could not
he be very young he say
he be ten or fifteen year young than i be
what could he see to attract he in a man like he ?
he be something in he face
i think i have take a chance
i be good at spot people who do belong
as soon as i saw he i know he be against them
them he appear mean the party and above all the inner party about who he talk with an open jeer hatred which make winston feel uneasy although he know that he be safe here if he could be safe anywhere
a thing that astonish he about he be the coarseness of he language
party member be supposed not to swear and winston himself very seldom do swear aloud at any rate
julia however seem unable to mention the party and especially the inner party without use the kind of word that he saw chalk up in dripping alley-way
he do not dislike he
he be merely one symptom of he revolt against the party and all he way and somehow he seem natural and healthy like the sneeze of a horse that smell bad hay
he have left the clearing and be wandering again through the chequer shade with he arms round each other have waist whenever he be wide enough to walk two abreast
he notice how much soft he waist seem to feel now that the sash be go
he do not speak above a whisper
outside the clearing julia say he be good to go quietly
presently he have reach the edge of the little wood
he stopped he
do go out into the open
there might be someone watch
he be all right if he keep behind the bough
he be standing in the shade of hazel bush
the sunlight filter through innumerable leave be still hot on he face
winston look out into the field beyond and undergo a curious slow shock of recognition
he know he by sight
an old closebitten pasture with a footpath wandering across he and a mole-hill here and there
in the ragged hedge on the opposite side the bough of the elm tree sway just perceptibly in the breeze and he leave stir faintly in dense masses like woman have hair
surely somewhere nearby but out of sight there musth be a stream with green pools where dace be swim ?
be there a stream somewhere near here ?
he whisper
that have right there be a stream
he have at the edge of the next field actually
there be fish in he great big one
he can watch them lie in the pools under the willow tree wave he tails
he have the golden country - almost he murmur
the golden country ?
he have nothing really
a landscape i have see sometimes in a dream
look ! whisper julia
a thrush have alight on a bough not five metre away almost at the level of he face
perhaps he have not see them
he be in the sun he in the shade
he spread out he wing fitted them carefully into place again duck he head for a moment as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun and then begin to pour forth a torrent of song
in the afternoon hush the volume of sound be startling
winston and julia cling together fascinate
the music go on and on minute after minute with astonishing variation never once repeat himself almost as though the bird be deliberately showing off he virtuosity
sometimes he stopped for a few second spread out and resettle he wing then swell he speckle breast and again burst into song
winston watch he with a sort of vague reverence
for who for what be that bird sing ?
no mate no rival be watch he
what make he sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour he music into nothingness ?
he wonder whether after all there be a microphone hide somewhere near
he and julia have speak only in low whisper and he would not pick up what he have say but he would pick up the thrush
perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small beetle-like man be listen intently - listen to that
but by degree the flood of music drive all speculation out of he mind
he be as though he be a kind of liquid stuff that pour all over he and get mixed up with the sunlight that filter through the leave
he stopped thinking and merely feel
the girl have waist in the bend of he arm be soft and warm
he pull he round so that he be breast to breast ; he body seem to melt into he
wherever he hands move he be all as yielding as water
he mouth cling together ; he be quite different from the hard kiss he have exchange earlier
when he move he face apart again both of them sigh deeply
the bird take fright and flee with a clatter of wing
winston put he lip against he ear
now he whisper
not here he whisper back
come back to the hide-out
he have safe
quickly with an occasional crackle of twig he thread he way back to the clearing
when he be once inside the ring of sapling he turn and face he
he be both breathing fast but the smile have reappear round the corner of he mouth
he stand look at he for an instant then feel at the zipper of he overall
and yes ! he be almost as in he dream
almost as swiftly as he have imagine he he have tear he clothes off and when he fling them aside he be with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seem to be annihilate
he body gleam white in the sun
but for a moment he do not look at he body ; he eyes be anchor by the freckled face with he faint bold smile
he kneel down before he and take he hands in he
have he done this before ?
of course
hundred of time - well score of time anyway
with party member ?
yes always with party member
with member of the inner party ?
not with those swine no
but there have plenty that would if he get half a chance
he be not so holy as he make out
he heart leap
score of time he have done he : he wish he have be hundred - thousand
anything that hint at corruption always fill he with a wild hope
who know perhaps the party be rotten under the surface he cult of strenuosity and self-denial simply a sham conceal iniquity
if he could have infect the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis how gladly he would have done so !
anything to rot to weaken to undermine !
he pull he down so that he be kneel face to face
listen
the more man he have have the more i love he
do he understand that ?
yes perfectly
i hate purity i hate goodness !
i do want any virtue to exist anywhere
i want everyone to be corrupt to the bone
well then i aught to suit he dear
i be corrupt to the bone
he like doing this ?
i do mean simply he : i mean the thing in himself ?
i adore he
that be above all what he want to hear
not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct the simple undifferentiated desire : that be the force that would tear the party to piece
he press he down upon the grass amongst the fall bluebell
this time there be no difficulty
presently the rising and fall of he breast slow to normal speed and in a sort of pleasant helplessness he fell apart
the sun seem to have grown hot
he be both sleepy
he reach out for the discard overall and pull them partly over he
almost immediately he fell asleep and sleep for about half an hour
winston wake first
he sit up and watch the freckled face still peacefully asleep pillow on the palm of he hand
except for he mouth he could not call he beautiful
there be a line or two round the eyes if he look closely
the short dark hair be extraordinarily thick and soft
he occur to he that he still do not know he surname or where he live
the young strong body now helpless in sleep awake in he a pity protect feeling
but the mindless tenderness that he have feel under the hazel tree while the thrush be sing have not quite come back
he pull the overall aside and studied he smooth white flank
in the old days he think a man look at a girl have body and saw that he be desirable and that be the end of the storey
but he could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays
no emotion be pure because everything be mixed up with fear and hatred
he embrace have be a battle the climax a victory
he be a blow strike against the party
he be a political act
he can come here once again say julia
he have generally safe to use any hide-out twice
but not for another month or two of course
as soon as he wake up he demeanour have change
he become alert and business-like put he clothes on knotted the scarlet sash about he waist and begin arrange the detail of the journey home
he seem natural to leave this to he
he obviously have a practical cunning which winston lack and he seem also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round london store away from innumerable community hike
the route he give he be quite different from the one by which he have come and bring he out at a different railway station
never go home the same way as he go out he say as though enunciate an important general principle
he would leave first and winston be to wait half an hour before following he
he have name a place where he could meet after work four evenings hence
he be a street in one of the poor quarters where there be an open market which be generally crowded and noisy
he would be hanging about amongst the stall pretend to be in search of shoelace or sewing-thread
if he judge that the coast be clear he would blow he nose when he approach ; otherwise he be to walk past he without recognition
but with luck in the middle of the crowd he would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting
and now i musth go he say as soon as he have master he instructions
i be due back at nineteen-thirty
i have get to put in two hours for the junior anti-sex league hand out leaflet or something
be he bloody ?
give he a brush-down would he ?
have i get any twig in he hair ?
be he sure ?
then good-bye he love good-bye !
he fling himself into he arms kiss he almost violently and a moment later pushed he way through the sapling and disappear into the wood with very little noise
even now he have not found out he surname or he address
however he make no difference for he be inconceivable that he could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of write communication
as he happen he never go back to the clearing in the wood
during the month of may there be only one further occasion on which he actually succeed in making love
that be in another hiding-place known to julia the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-desert stretch of country where an atomic bomb have fall thirty year earlier
he be a good hiding-place when once he get there but the get there be very dangerous
for the rest he could meet only in the street in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time
in the street he be usually possible to talk after a fashion
as he drift down the crowded pavement not quite abreast and never look at one another he carry on a curious intermittent conversation which flick on and off like the beam of a lighthouse suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen then take up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence then abruptly cut short as he parted at the agreed spot then continue almost without introduction on the following day
julia appear to be quite used to this kind of conversation which he call talk by instalment
he be also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving he lip
just once in almost a month of nightly meeting he manage to exchange a kiss
he be passing in silence down a side-street ( julia would never speak when he be away from the main street ) when there be a deafen roar the earth heave and the air darken and winston found himself lie on he side bruised and terrify
a rocket bomb musth have drop quite near at hand
suddenly he become aware of julia have face a few centimetre from he own deathly white as white as chalk
even he lip be white
he be dead !
he clasp he against he and found that he be kissing a live warm face
but there be some powdery stuff that get in the way of he lip
both of he face be thickly coated with plaster
there be evenings when he reach he rendezvous and then have to walk past one another without a sign because a patrol have just come round the corner or a helicopter be hover overhead
even if he have be less dangerous he would still have be difficult to find time to meet
winston have working week be sixty hours julia have be even longer and he free days varied according to the pressure of work and do not often coincide
julia in any case seldom have an evening completely free
he spend an astonishing amount of time in attend lecture and demonstration distribute literature for the junior anti-sex league prepare banner for hate week making collection for the saving campaign and such-like activity
he pay he say he be camouflage
if he keep the small rule he could break the big one
he even induce winston to mortgage yet another of he evenings by enroll himself for the part-time munition work which be done voluntarily by zealous party member
so one evening every week winston spend four hours of paralyse boredom screw together small bit of metal which be probably parts of bomb fuse in a draughty ill-light workshop where the knock of hammer mingle drearily with the music of the telescreens
when he meet in the church tower the gap in he fragmentary conversation be fill up
he be a blaze afternoon
the air in the little square chamber above the bell be hot and stagnant and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung
he sit talk for hours on the dusty twig-litter floor one or other of them get up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one be coming
julia be twenty-six year old
he live in a hostel with thirty other girl ( always in the stink of woman !
how i hate woman ! he say parenthetically ) and he worked as he have guess on the novel-writing machine in the fiction department
he enjoy he work which consist chiefly in running and service a powerful but tricky electric motor
he be not clever but be fond of use he hands and feel at home with machinery
he could describe the whole process of compose a novel from the general directive issue by the plan committee down to the final touching-up by the rewrite squad
but he be not interested in the finished product
he do much care for reading he say
book be just a commodity that have to be produce like jam or bootlace
he have no memory of anything before the early sixty and the only person he have ever known who talk frequently of the days before the revolution be a grandfather who have disappear when he be eight
at school he have be captain of the hockey team and have win the gymnastics trophy two year running
he have be a troop-leader in the spy and a branch secretary in the youth league before join the junior anti-sex league
he have always bear an excellent character
he have even ( an infallible mark of good reputation ) be pick out to work in pornosec the sub-section of the fiction department which turn out cheap pornography for distribution amongst the prole
he be nickname muck house by the people who worked in he he remark
there he have remain for a year helping to produce booklet in seal packet with title like spanking storey or one night in a girl ' school to be buy furtively by proletarian youth who be under the impression that he be buy something illegal
what be these book like ?
say winston curiously
oh ghastly rubbish
he be boring really
he only have six plot but he swap them round a bit
of course i be only on the kaleidoscope
i be never in the rewrite squad
i be not literary dear - not even enough for that
he learned with astonishment that all the worker in pornosec except the heads of the department be girl
the theory be that man who sex instinct be less controllable than those of woman be in great danger of be corrupt by the filth he handled
he do even like have married woman there he add
girl be always supposed to be so pure
here have one who be anyway
he have have he first love-affair when he be sixteen with a party member of sixty who later commit suicide to avoid arrest
and a good job too say julia otherwise he have have have he name out of he when he confess
since then there have be various other
life as he saw he be quite simple
he want a good time ; he meaning the party want to stop he have he ; he break the rule as good he could
he seem to think he just as natural that he should want to rob he of he pleasure as that he should want to avoid be catch
he hate the party and say so in the crude word but he make no general criticism of he
except where he touched upon he own life he have no interest in party doctrine
he notice that he never used newspeak word except the one that have pass into everyday use
he have never hear of the brotherhood and refuse to believe in he existence
any kind of organize revolt against the party which be bound to be a failure strike he as stupid
the clever thing be to break the rule and stay alive all the same
he wonder vaguely how many other like he there might be in the young generation people who have grown up in the world of the revolution knowing nothing else accept the party as something unalterable like the sky not rebel against he authority but simply evade he as a rabbit dodge a dog
he do not discuss the possibility of get married
he be too remote to be worth thinking about
no imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if katharine winston have wife could somehow have be get rid of
he be hopeless even as a day-dream
what be he like he wife ?
say julia
he be - do he know the newspeak word goodthinkful ?
meaning naturally orthodox incapable of thinking a bad think ?
no i do know the word but i know the kind of person right enough
he begin telling he the storey of he married life but curiously enough he appear to know the essential parts of he already
he describe to he almost as though he have see or feel he the stiffen of katharine have body as soon as he touched he the way in which he still seem to be pushing he from he with all he strength even when he arms be clasp tightly round he
with julia he feel no difficulty in talk about such thing : katharine in any case have long cease to be a painful memory and become merely a distasteful one
i could have stand he if he hadn't be for one thing he say
he tell he about the frigid little ceremony that katharine have forced he to go through on the same night every week
he hate he but nothing would make he stop doing he
he used to call he - but he will never guess
he duty to the party say julia promptly
how do he know that ?
i have be at school too dear
sex talk once a month for the over-sixteen
and in the youth movement
he rub he into he for year
i dare say he works in a lot of case
but of course he can never tell ; people be such hypocrite
he begin to enlarge upon the subject
with julia everything came back to he own sexuality
as soon as this be touched upon in any way he be capable of great acuteness
unlike winston he have grasp the inner meaning of the party have sexual puritanism
he be not merely that the sex instinct create a world of he own which be outside the party have control and which therefore have to be destroy if possible
what be more important be that sexual privation induce hysteria which be desirable because he could be transform into war-fever and leader-worship
the way he put he be :
when he make love he be use up energy ; and afterward he feel happy and do give a damn for anything
he can bear he to feel like that
he want he to be burst with energy all the time
all this march up and down and cheer and wave flagstone be simply sex go sour
if he be happy inside himself why should he get excited about big brother and the three-year plan and the two minutes hate and all the rest of he bloody rot ?
that be very true he think
there be a direct intimate connection between chastity and political orthodoxy
for how could the fear the hatred and the lunatic credulity which the party need in he member be keep at the right pitch except by bottle down some powerful instinct and use he as a driving force ?
the sex impulse be dangerous to the party and the party have turn he to account
he have play a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood
the family could not actually be abolish and indeed people be encourage to be fond of he child in almost the old-fashioned way
the child on the other hand be systematically turn against he parent and teach to spy on them and report he deviation
the family have become in effect an extension of the think police
he be a device by means of which everyone could be surround night and day by informer who know he intimately
abruptly he mind go back to katharine
katharine would unquestionably have denounce he to the think police if he have not happen to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of he opinion
but what really recall he to he at this moment be the stifling heat of the afternoon which have bring the sweat out on he forehead
he begin telling julia of something that have happen or rather have fail to happen on another sweltering summer afternoon eleven year ago
he be three or four month after he be married
he have lose he way on a community hike somewhere in ken
he have only lag behind the other for a couple of minutes but he take a wrong turning and presently found himself pull up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry
he be a sheer drop of ten or twenty metre with boulder at the bottom
there be nobody of who he could ask the way
as soon as he realize that he be lose katharine become very uneasy
to be away from the noisy mob of hiker even for a moment give he a feeling of wrong-doing
he want to hurry back by the way he have come and start searching in the other direction
but at this moment winston notice some tuft of loosestrife grow in the crack of the cliff beneath them
one tuft be of two colours magenta and brick-red apparently grow on the same root
he have never see anything of the kind before and he call to katharine to come and look at he
look katharine !
look at those flower
that clump down near the bottom
do he see he be two different colours ?
he have already turn to go but he do rather fretfully come back for a moment
he even lean out over the cliff face to see where he be pointing
he be standing a little behind he and he put he hand on he waist to steady he
at this moment he suddenly occur to he how completely alone he be
there be not a human creature anywhere not a leaf stirring not even a bird awake
in a place like this the danger that there would be a hide microphone be very small and even if there be a microphone he would only pick up sound
he be the hot sleepy hour of the afternoon
the sun blaze down upon them the sweat tickle he face
and the think strike he .
why do he give he a good shove ?
say julia
i would have
yes dear he would have
i would if i have be the same person then as i be now
or perhaps i would - i be not certain
be he sorry he do ?
yes
on the whole i be sorry i do
he be sitting side by side on the dusty floor
he pull he closer against he
he head rest on he shoulder the pleasant smell of he hair conquer the pigeon dung
he be very young he think he still expect something from life he do not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solve nothing
actually he would have make no difference he say
then why be he sorry he do do he ?
only because i prefer a positive to a negative
in this game that he be play he can win
some kind of failure be good than other kind that have all
he feel he shoulder give a wriggle of dissent
he always contradict he when he say anything of this kind
he would not accept he as a law of nature that the individual be always defeat
in a way he realize that he himself be doom that sooner or later the think police would catch he and kill he but with another part of he mind he believe that he be somehow possible to construct a secret world in which he could live as he chose
all he need be luck and cunning and boldness
he do not understand that there be no such thing as happiness that the only victory lay in the far future long after he be dead that from the moment of declare war on the party he be good to think of himself as a corpse
he be the dead he say
he be not dead yet say julia prosaically
not physically
six month a year - five year conceivably
i be afraid of death
he be young so presumably he be more afraid of he than i be
obviously he shall put he off as long as he can
but he make very little difference
so long as human being stay human death and life be the same thing
oh rubbish !
which would he sooner sleep with he or a skeleton ?
do he enjoy be alive ?
do he like feeling : this be he this be he hand this be he leg i be real i be solid i be alive !
do he like this ?
he twist himself round and press he bosom against he
he could feel he breast ripe yet firm through he overall
he body seem to be pour some of he youth and vigour into he
yes i like that he say
then stop talk about dye
and now listen dear he have get to fix up about the next time he meet
he may as well go back to the place in the wood
he have give he a good long rest
but he musth get there by a different way this time
i have get he all plan out
he take the train - but look i will draw he out for he
and in he practical way he scrape together a small square of dust and with a twig from a pigeon have nest begin drawing a map on the floor
winston look round the shabby little room above mr charrington have shop
beside the window the enormous bed be make up with ragged blanket and a coverless bolster
the old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face be ticking away on the mantelpiece
in the corner on the gateleg table the glass paper-weight which he have buy on he last visit gleam softly out of the half-darkness
in the fender be a batter tin oilstove a saucepan and two cup provided by mr charrington
winston light the burner and set a pan of water to boil
he have bring an envelope full of victory coffee and some saccharine tablet
the clock have hands say seventeen-twenty : he be nineteen-twenty really
he be coming at nineteen-thirty
folly folly he heart keep saying : conscious gratuitous suicidal folly
of all the crime that a party member could commit this one be the least possible to conceal
actually the idea have first float into he head in the forme of a vision of the glass paper-weight mirror by the surface of the gateleg table
as he have foresee mr charrington have make no difficulty about let the room
he be obviously glad of the few dollar that he would bring he
nor do he seem shock or become offensively knowing when he be make clear that winston want the room for the purpose of a love-affair
instead he look into the middle distance and spoke in generality with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he have become partly invisible
privacy he say be a very valuable thing
everyone want a place where he could be alone occasionally
and when he have such a place he be only common courtesy in anyone else who know of he to keep he knowledge to himself
he even seeming almost to fade out of existence as he do so add that there be two entry to the house one of them through the back yard which give on an alley
under the window somebody be sing
winston peep out secure in the protection of the muslin curtain
the june sun be still high in the sky and in the sun-fill court below a monstrous woman solid as a norman pillar with brawny red forearm and a sacking apron strapped about he middle be stump to and fro between a wash-tub and a clothes line peg out a series of square white thing which winston recognize as baby ' diaper
whenever he mouth be not corked with clothes peg he be sing in a powerful contralto :
he be only an 'opeless fancy
he pass like an ipril dye
but a look and a word and the dream he stir !
he 'ave steal he 'eart awye !
the tune have be haunting london for week past
he be one of countless similar song publish for the benefit of the prole by a sub-section of the music department
the word of these song be composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator
but the woman sing so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound
he could hear the woman sing and the scrape of he shoe on the flagstone and the cry of the child in the street and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic and yet the room seem curiously silent thanks to the absence of a telescreen
folly folly folly ! he think again
he be inconceivable that he could frequent this place for more than a few week without be catch
but the temptation of have a hiding-place that be truly he own indoors and near at hand have be too much for both of them
for some time after he visit to the church belfry he have be impossible to arrange meeting
working hours have be drastically increase in anticipation of hate week
he be more than a month distant but the enormous complex preparation that he entail be throw extra work on to everybody
finally both of them manage to secure a free afternoon on the same day
he have agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood
on the evening beforehand he meet briefly in the street
as usual winston hardly look at julia as he drift towards one another in the crowd but from the short glance he give he he seem to he that he be pale than usual
he have all off he murmur as soon as he judge he safe to speak
tomorrow i mean
what ?
tomorrow afternoon
i can come
why not ?
oh the usual reason
he have start early this time
for a moment he be violently angry
during the month that he have known he the nature of he desire for he have change
at the beginning there have be little true sensuality in he
he first love-making have be simply an act of the will
but after the second time he be different
the smell of he hair the taste of he mouth the feeling of he skin seem to have get inside he or into the air all round he
he have become a physical necessity something that he not only want but feel that he have a right to
when he say that he could not come he have the feeling that he be cheat he
but just at this moment the crowd press them together and he hands accidentally meet
he give the tip of he finger a quick squeeze that seem to invite not desire but affection
he strike he that when one live with a woman this particular disappointment musth be a normal recur event ; and a deep tenderness such as he have not feel for he before suddenly take hold of he
he wish that he be a married couple of ten year ' standing
he wish that he be walking through the street with he just as he be doing now but openly and without fear talk of triviality and buy odds and end for the household
he wish above all that he have some place where he could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time he meet
he be not actually at that moment but at some time on the following day that the idea of rent mr charrington have room have occur to he
when he suggest he to julia he have agreed with unexpected readiness
both of them know that he be lunacy
he be as though he be intentionally step near to he grave
as he sit wait on the edge of the bed he think again of the cellar of the ministry of love
he be curious how that predestine horror move in and out of one have consciousness
there he lay fixed in future time preceding death as surely as 99 precede 100
one could not avoid he but one could perhaps postpone he : and yet instead every now and again by a conscious wilful act one chose to shorten the interval before he happen
at this moment there be a quick step on the stairs
julia burst into the room
he be carry a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas such as he have sometimes see he carry to and fro at the ministry
he start forward to take he in he arms but he disengage himself rather hurriedly partly because he be still holding the tool-bag
half a second he say
just let he show he what i have bring
do he bring some of that filthy victory coffee ?
i think he would
he can chuck he away again because he shall be need he
look here
he fell on he knee throw open the bag and tumble out some spanner and a screw-driver that fill the top part of he
underneath be a number of neat paper packet
the first packet that he pass to winston have a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling
he be fill with some kind of heavy sand-like stuff which yield wherever he touched he
he be sugar ?
he say
real sugar
not saccharine sugar
and here have a loaf of bread proper white bread not he bloody stuff - and a little pot of jam
and here have a tin of milk - but look !
this be the one i be really proud of
i have to wrap a bit of sacking round he because -
but he do not need to tell he why he have wrapped he up
the smell be already filling the room a rich hot smell which seem like an emanation from he early childhood but which one do occasionally meet with even now blow down a passage-way before a door slam or diffuse himself mysteriously in a crowded street sniff for an instant and then lose again
he have coffee he murmur real coffee
he have inner party coffee
there have a whole kilo here he say
how do he manage to get hold of all these thing ?
he have all inner party stuff
there have nothing those swine do have nothing
but of course waiter and servant and people pinch thing and - look i get a little packet of tea as well
winston have squat down beside he
he tear open a corner of the packet
he have real tea
not blackberry leave
there have be a lot of tea about lately
he have capture india or something he say vaguely
but listen dear
i want he to turn he back on he for three minutes
go and sit on the other side of the bed
do go too near the window
and do turn round till i tell he
winston gaze abstractedly through the muslin curtain
down in the yard the red-armed woman be still march to and fro between the wash-tub and the line
he take two more peg out of he mouth and sing with deep feeling :
he sye that time 'eals all thing
he sye he can always forget ;
but the smile and the tears acrorss the year
he twist he 'eart-string yet !
he know the whole drivel song by heart he seem
he voice float upward with the sweet summer air very tuneful charge with a sort of happy melancholy
one have the feeling that he would have be perfectly content if the june evening have be endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible to remain there for a thousand year peg out diaper and sing rubbish
he strike he as a curious fact that he have never hear a member of the party sing alone and spontaneously
he would even have seem slightly unorthodox a dangerous eccentricity like talk to oneself
perhaps he be only when people be somewhere near the starvation level that he have anything to sing about
he can turn round now say julia
he turn round and for a second almost fail to recognize he
what he have actually expect be to see he naked
but he be not naked
the transformation that have happen be much more surprising than that
he have paint he face
he musth have slip into some shop in the proletarian quarters and buy himself a complete set of make-up materials
he lip be deeply redden he cheek rouge he nose powder ; there be even a touch of something under the eyes to make them bright
he be not very skilfully done but winston have standard in such matter be not high
he have never before see or imagine a woman of the party with cosmetic on he face
the improvement in he appearance be startling
with just a few dab of colour in the right place he have become not only very much pretty but above all far more feminine
he short hair and boyish overall merely add to the effect
as he take he in he arms a wave of synthetic violet flood he nostril
he remember the half-darkness of a basement kitchen and a woman have cavernous mouth
he be the very same scent that he have used ; but at the moment he do not seem to matter
scent too ! he say
yes dear scent too
and do he know what i be going to do next ?
i be going to get hold of a real woman have frock from somewhere and wear he instead of these bloody trousers
i will wear silk stocking and high-heeled shoe !
in this room i be going to be a woman not a party comrade
he fling he clothes off and climb into the huge mahogany bed
he be the first time that he have strip himself naked in he presence
until now he have be too much ashamed of he pale and meagre body with the varicose vein standing out on he calve and the discolour patch over he ankle
there be no sheet but the blanket he lay on be threadbare and smooth and the size and springiness of the bed astonish both of them
he have sure to be full of bug but who care ?
say julia
one never saw a double bed nowadays except in the home of the prole
winston have occasionally sleep in one in he boyhood : julia have never be in one before so far as he could remember
presently he fell asleep for a little while
when winston wake up the hands of the clock have creep round to nearly nine
he do not stir because julia be sleep with he head in the crook of he arm
most of he make-up have transfer himself to he own face or the bolster but a light stain of rouge still bring out the beauty of he cheekbone
a yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and light up the fireplace where the water in the pan be boiling fast
down in the yard the woman have stopped sing but the faint shout of child float in from the street
he wonder vaguely whether in the abolish past he have be a normal experience to lie in bed like this in the cool of a summer evening a man and a woman with no clothes on making love when he chose talk of what he chose not feeling any compulsion to get up simply lie there and listen to peaceful sound outside
surely there could never have be a time when that seem ordinary ?
julia wake up rub he eyes and raise himself on he elbow to look at the oilstove
half that water have boil away he say
i will get up and make some coffee in another moment
he have get an hour
what time do he cut the lights off at he flats ?
twenty-three thirty
he have twenty-three at the hostel
but he have to get in earlier than that because - hi !
get out he filthy brute !
he suddenly twist himself over in the bed seize a shoe from the floor and send he hurtle into the corner with a boyish jerk of he arm exactly as he have see he fling the dictionary at goldstein that morning during the two minutes hate
what be he ?
he say in surprise
a rat
i saw he stick he beastly nose out of the wainscot
there have a hole down there
i give he a good fright anyway
rat ! murmur winston
in this room !
he be all over the place say julia indifferently as he lay down again
he have even get them in the kitchen at the hostel
some parts of london be swarm with them
do he know he attack child ?
yes he do
in some of these street a woman daren't leave a baby alone for two minutes
he have the great huge brown one that do he
and the nasty thing be that the brute always -
do go on ! say winston with he eyes tightly shut
dear !
he have go quite pale
what have the matter ?
do he make he feel sick ?
of all horrors in the world - a rat !
he press himself against he and wind he limb round he as though to reassure he with the warmth of he body
he do not reopen he eyes immediately
for several moment he have have the feeling of be back in a nightmare which have recur from time to time throughout he life
he be always very much the same
he be standing in front of a wall of darkness and on the other side of he there be something unendurable something too dreadful to be face
in the dream he deep feeling be always one of self-deception because he do in fact know what be behind the wall of darkness
with a deadly effort like wrench a piece out of he own brain he could even have drag the thing into the open
he always wake up without discover what he be : but somehow he be connected with what julia have be saying when he cut he short
i be sorry he say he have nothing
i do like rat that have all
do worry dear he be not going to have the filthy brute in here
i will stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before he go
and next time he come here i will bring some plaster and bung he up properly
already the black instant of panic be half-forget
feeling slightly ashamed of himself he sit up against the bedhead
julia get out of bed pull on he overall and make the coffee
the smell that rose from the saucepan be so powerful and exciting that he shut the window lest anybody outside should notice he and become inquisitive
what be even good than the taste of the coffee be the silky texture give to he by the sugar a thing winston have almost forget after year of saccharine
with one hand in he pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other julia wander about the room glance indifferently at the bookcase pointing out the good way of repair the gateleg table plump himself down in the ragged arm-chair to see if he be comfortable and examine the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement
he bring the glass paper-weight over to the bed to have a look at he in a good light
he take he out of he hand fascinate as always by the soft rainwatery appearance of the glass
what be he do he think ?
say julia
i do think he have anything - i mean i do think he be ever put to any use
that have what i like about he
he have a little chunk of history that he have forget to alter
he have a message from a hundred year ago if one know how to read he
and that picture over there - he nod at the engraving on the opposite wall - would that be a hundred year old ?
more
two hundred i dare say
one can tell
he have impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays
he go over to look at he
here have where that brute stick he nose out he say kick the wainscot immediately below the picture
what be this place ?
i have see he before somewhere
he have a church or at least he used to be
st clement danes he name be
the fragment of rhyme that mr charrington have teach he came back into he head and he add half-nostalgically : orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have !
to he astonishment he cap the line :
he owe he three farthing say the bell of st martin have
when will he pay he ? say the bell of old bailey -
i can remember how he go on after that
but anyway i remember he end up here come a candle to light he to bed here come a chopper to chop off he head !
he be like the two halve of a countersign
but there musth be another line after the bell of old bailey
perhaps he could be dig out of mr charrington have memory if he be suitably prompt
who teach he that ?
he say
he grandfather
he used to say he to he when i be a little girl
he be vaporize when i be eight - at any rate he disappear
i wonder what a lemon be he add inconsequentially
i have see orange
he be a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin
i can remember lemon say winston
he be quite common in the fifty
he be so sour that he set he tooth on edge even to smell them
i bet that picture have get bug behind he say julia
i will take he down and give he a good clean some day
i suppose he have almost time he be leave
i musth start washing this paint off
what a bore !
i will get the lipstick off he face afterward
winston do not get up for a few minutes more
the room be darken
he turn over towards the light and lay gaze into the glass paper-weight
the inexhaustibly interesting thing be not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass himself
there be such a depth of he and yet he be almost as transparent as air
he be as though the surface of the glass have be the arch of the sky enclose a tiny world with he atmosphere complete
he have the feeling that he could get inside he and that in fact he be inside he along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table and the clock and the steel engraving and the paper-weight himself
the paper-weight be the room he be in and the coral be julia have life and he own fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal
syme have vanish
a morning came and he be missing from work : a few thoughtless people comment on he absence
on the next day nobody mention he
on the third day winston go into the vestibule of the record department to look at the notice-board
one of the notice carry a print list of the member of the chessman committee of who syme have be one
he look almost exactly as he have look before - nothing have be cross out - but he be one name short
he be enough
syme have cease to exist : he have never exist
the weather be bake hot
in the labyrinthine ministry the windowless air-condition room keep he normal temperature but outside the pavement scorch one have foot and the stench of the tube at the rush hours be a horror
the preparation for hate week be in full swing and the staff of all the ministry be working overtime
procession meeting military parade lecture waxwork display film show telescreen programme all have to be organize ; stand have to be erect effigy build slogan coin song write rumour circulate photograph fake
julia have unit in the fiction department have be take off the production of novel and be rush out a series of atrocity pamphlet
winston in addition to he regular work spend long period every day in going through back file of the time and alter and embellish news item which be to be quoted in speech
late at night when crowd of rowdy prole roam the street the town have a curiously febrile air
the rocket bomb crash often than ever and sometimes in the far distance there be enormous explosion which no one could explain and about which there be wild rumour
the new tune which be to be the theme-song of hate week ( the hate song he be call ) have already be composed and be be endlessly plug on the telescreens
he have a savage bark rhythm which could not exactly be call music but resemble the beating of a drum
roar out by hundred of voice to the tramp of march foot he be terrify
the prole have take a fancy to he and in the midnight street he compete with the still-popular he be only a hopeless fancy
the parson child play he at all hours of the night and day unbearably on a comb and a piece of toilet paper
winston have evenings be fuller than ever
squad of volunteer organize by parson be prepare the street for hate week stitch banner painting poster erect flagpole on the roof and perilously sling wire across the street for the reception of streamer
parson boast that victory mansion alone would display four hundred metre of bunting
he be in he native element and as happy as a lark
the heat and the manual work have even give he a pretext for revert to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings
he be everywhere at once pushing pull saw hammer improvise jolly everyone along with comradely exhortation and give out from every fold of he body what seem an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smell sweat
a new poster have suddenly appear all over london
he have no caption and re-present simply the monstrous figure of a eurasian soldier three or four metre high stride forward with expressionless mongolism face and enormous boots a submachine gun pointed from he hip
from whatever angle he look at the poster the muzzle of the gun magnify by the foreshorten seem to be pointed straight at he
the thing have be plastered on every blank space on every wall even outnumber the portrait of big brother
the prole normally apathetic about the war be be lash into one of he periodical frenzy of patriotism
as though to harmonize with the general mood the rocket bomb have be killing large number of people than usual
one fell on a crowded film theatre in stepney bury several hundred victim amongst the ruin
the whole population of the neighbourhood turn out for a long trail funeral which go on for hours and be in effect an indignation meeting
another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which be used as a playground and several dozen child be blow to piece
there be further angry demonstration goldstein be burned in effigy hundred of copy of the poster of the eurasian soldier be tear down and add to the flame and a number of shop be loot in the turmoil ; then a rumour fly round that spy be direct the rocket bomb by means of wireless wave and an old couple who be suspect of be of foreign extraction have he house set on fire and perished of suffocation
in the room over mr charrington have shop when he could get there julia and winston lay side by side on a strip bed under the open window naked for the sake of coolness
the rat have never come back but the bug have multiply hideously in the heat
he do not seem to matter
dirty or clean the room be paradise
as soon as he arrive he would sprinkle everything with pepper buy on the black market tear off he clothes and make love with sweat body then fall asleep and wake to find that the bug have rally and be mass for the counter-attack
four five six - seven time he meet during the month of june
winston have drop he habit of drink gin at all hours
he seem to have lose the need for he
he have grown fat he varicose ulcer have subside leave only a brown stain on the skin above he ankle he fit of cough in the early morning have stopped
the process of life have cease to be intolerable he have no longer any impulse to make face at the telescreen or shout curse at the top of he voice
now that he have a secure hiding-place almost a home he do not even seem a hardship that he could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time
what matter be that the room over the junk-shop should exist
to know that he be there inviolate be almost the same as be in he
the room be a world a pocket of the past where extinct animal could walk
mr charrington think winston be another extinct animal
he usually stopped to talk with mr charrington for a few minutes on he way upstairs
the old man seem seldom or never to go out of door and on the other hand to have almost no customer
he lead a ghostlike existence between the tiny dark shop and an even tiny back kitchen where he prepare he meal and which contain amongst other thing an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an enormous horn
he seem glad of the opportunity to talk
wandering about amongst he worthless stock with he long nose and thick spectacles and he bow shoulder in the velvet jacket he have always vaguely the air of be a collector rather than a tradesman
with a sort of fade enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that - a china bottle-stopper the paint lid of a break snuff-box a pinchbeck locket contain a strand of some long-dead baby have hair - never ask that winston should buy he merely that he should admire he
to talk to he be like listen to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box
he have drag out from the corner of he memory some more fragment of forget rhyme
there be one about four and twenty blackbird and another about a cow with a crumple horn and another about the death of poor cock robin
he just occur to he he might be interested he would say with a deprecate little laugh whenever he produce a new fragment
but he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme
both of them know - in a way he be never out of he mind that what be now happening could not last long
there be time when the fact of impending death seem as palpable as the bed he lay on and he would cling together with a sort of despair sensuality like a damned soul grasping at he last morsel of pleasure when the clock be within five minutes of striking
but there be also time when he have the illusion not only of safety but of permanence
so long as he be actually in this room he both feel no harm could come to them
get there be difficult and dangerous but the room himself be sanctuary
he be as when winston have gaze into the heart of the paper-weight with the feeling that he would be possible to get inside that glassy world and that once inside he time could be arrest
often he give himself up to day-dream of escape
he luck would hold indefinitely and he would carry on he intrigue just like this for the remainder of he natural live
or katharine would die and by subtle manoeuvrings winston and julia would succeed in get married
or he would commit suicide together
or he would disappear alter himself out of recognition learn to speak with proletarian accent get job in a factory and live out he live undetected in a back-street
he be all nonsense as he both know
in reality there be no escape
even the one plan that be practicable suicide he have no intention of carry out
to hang on from day to day and from week to week spinning out a present that have no future seem an unconquerable instinct just as one have lung will always draw the next breath so long as there be air available
sometimes too he talk of engaging in active rebellion against the party but with no notion of how to take the first step
even if the fabulous brotherhood be a reality there still remain the difficulty of finding one have way into he
he tell he of the strange intimacy that exist or seem to exist between himself and o'brien and of the impulse he sometimes feel simply to walk into o'brien have presence announce that he be the enemy of the party and demand he help
curiously enough this do not strike he as an impossibly rash thing to do
he be used to judge people by he face and he seem natural to he that winston should believe o'brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes
moreover he take he for grant that everyone or nearly everyone secretly hate the party and would break the rule if he think he safe to do so
but he refuse to believe that widespread organize opposition exist or could exist
the tales about goldstein and he underground army he say be simply a lot of rubbish which the party have invent for he own purpose and which he have to pretend to believe in
time beyond number at party rally and spontaneous demonstration he have shout at the top of he voice for the execution of people who name he have never hear and in who supposed crime he have not the faint belief
when public trial be happening he have take he place in the detachment from the youth league who surround the court from morning to night chant at interval death to the traitor !
during the two minutes hate he always excel all other in shout insult at goldstein
yet he have only the dim idea of who goldstein be and what doctrine he be supposed to re-present
he have grown up since the revolution and be too young to remember the ideological battle of the fifty and sixty
such a thing as an independent political movement be outside he imagination : and in any case the party be invincible
he would always exist and he would always be the same
he could only rebel against he by secret disobedience or at most by isolate act of violence such as killing somebody or blow something up
in some way he be far more acute than winston and far less susceptible to party propaganda
once when he happen in some connection to mention the war against eurasia he startle he by saying casually that in he opinion the war be not happening
the rocket bomb which fell daily on london be probably fire by the government of oceania himself just to keep people frighten
this be an idea that have literally never occur to he
he also stir a sort of envy in he by telling he that during the two minutes hate he great difficulty be to avoid burst out laugh
but he only question the teaching of the party when he in some way touched upon he own life
often he be ready to accept the official mythology simply because the difference between truth and falsehood do not seem important to he
he believe for instance have learn he at school that the party have invent aeroplane
 ( in he own schooldays winston remember in the late fifty he be only the helicopter that the party claim to have invent ; a dozen year later when julia be at school he be already claim the aeroplane ; one generation more and he would be claim the steam engine ) 
and when he tell he that aeroplane have be in existence before he be born and long before the revolution the fact strike he as totally uninteresting
after all what do he matter who have invent aeroplane ?
he be rather more of a shock to he when he discover from some chance remarque that he do not remember that oceania four year ago have be at war with eastasia and at peace with eurasia
he be true that he regard the whole war as a sham : but apparently he have not even notice that the name of the enemy have change
i think he have always be at war with eurasia he say vaguely
he frighten he a little
the invention of aeroplane dated from long before he birth but the switchover in the war have happen only four year ago well after he be grown up
he argue with he about he for perhaps a quarter of an hour
in the end he succeed in force he memory back until he do dimly recall that at one time eastasia and not eurasia have be the enemy
but the issue still strike he as unimportant
who care ?
he say impatiently
he have always one bloody war after another and one know the news be all lie anyway
sometimes he talk to he of the record department and the impudent forgery that he commit there
such thing do not appear to horrify he
he do not feel the abyss opening beneath he foot at the think of lie becoming truth
he tell he the storey of jones aaronson and rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he have once hold between he finger
he do not make much impression on he
at first indeed he fail to grasp the point of the storey
be he friend of he ?
he say
no i never know them
he be inner party member
besides he be far old man than i be
he belong to the old days before the revolution
i barely know them by sight
then what be there to worry about ?
people be be kill off all the time be he ?
he try to make he understand
this be an exceptional case
he wasn't just a question of somebody be kill
do he realize that the past start from yesterday have be actually abolish ?
if he survive anywhere he have in a few solid object with no word attached to them like that lump of glass there
already he know almost literally nothing about the revolution and the year before the revolution
every record have be destroy or falsify every book have be rewrite every picture have be repainted every statue and street and building have be rename every date have be alter
and that process be continue day by day and minute by minute
history have stopped
nothing exist except an endless present in which the party be always right
i know of course that the past be falsify but he would never be possible for he to prove he even when i do the falsification himself
after the thing be done no evidence ever remains
the only evidence be inside he own mind and i do know with any certainty that any other human be share he memory
just in that one instance in he whole life i do possess actual concrete evidence after the event - year after he
and what good be that ?
he be no good because i throw he away a few minutes later
but if the same thing happen today i should keep he
well i would ! say julia
i be quite ready to take risk but only for something worth while not for bit of old newspaper
what could he have done with he even if he have keep he ?
not much perhaps
but he be evidence
he might have plant a few doubt here and there suppose that i have dare to show he to anybody
i do imagine that he can alter anything in he own lifetime
but one can imagine little knot of resistance springing up here and there - small group of people band himself together and gradually grow and even leave a few record behind so that the next generation can carry on where he leave off
i be not interested in the next generation dear
i be interested in he
he be only a rebel from the waist downward he tell he
he think this brilliantly witty and fling he arms round he in delight
in the ramification of party doctrine he have not the faint interest
whenever he begin to talk of the principle of ingsoc double-think the mutability of the past and the denial of objective reality and to use newspeak word he become bore and confuse and say that he never pay any attention to that kind of thing
one know that he be all rubbish so why let oneself be worry by he ?
he know when to cheer and when to boo and that be all one need
if he persist in talk of such subject he have a disconcert habit of fall asleep
he be one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position
talk to he he realize how easy he be to present an appearance of orthodoxy while have no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy mean
in a way the world-view of the party impose himself most successfully on people incapable of understanding he
he could be make to accept the most flagrant violation of reality because he never fully grasp the enormity of what be demand of them and be not sufficiently interested in public event to notice what be happening
by lack of understanding he remain sane
he simply swallow everything and what he swallow do them no harm because he left no residue behind just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird
he have happen at last
the expect message have come
all he life he seem to he he have be wait for this to happen
he be walking down the long corridor at the ministry and he be almost at the spot where julia have slip the note into he hand when he become aware that someone large than himself be walking just behind he
the person whoever he be give a small cough evidently as a prelude to speaking
winston stopped abruptly and turn
he be o'brien
at last he be face to face and he seem that he only impulse be to run away
he heart bound violently
he would have be incapable of speaking
o'brien however have continue forward in the same movement lay a friendly hand for a moment on winston have arm so that the two of them be walking side by side
he begin speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiate he from the majority of inner party member
i have be hope for an opportunity of talk to he he say
i be reading one of he newspeak article in the time the other day
he take a scholarly interest in newspeak i believe ?
winston have re-cover part of he self-possession
hardly scholarly he say
i be only an amateur
he have not he subject
i have never have anything to do with the actual construction of the language
but he write he very elegantly say o'brien
that be not only he own opinion
i be talk recently to a friend of he who be certainly an expert
he name have slip he memory for the moment
again winston have heart stir painfully
he be inconceivable that this be anything other than a reference to syme
but syme be not only dead he be abolish an unperson
any identifiable reference to he would have be mortally dangerous
o'brien have remarque musth obviously have be intended as a signal a codeword
by share a small act of thoughtcrime he have turn the two of them into accomplice
he have continue to stroll slowly down the corridor but now o'brien halt
with the curious disarming friendliness that he always manage to put in to the gesture he resettle he spectacles on he nose
then he go on :
what i have really intended to say be that in he article i notice he have used two word which have become obsolete
but he have only become so very recently
have he see the tenth edition of the newspeak dictionary ?
no say winston
i do think he have be issue yet
he be still use the ninth in the record department
the tenth edition be not due to appear for some month i believe
but a few advance copy have be circulate
i have one himself
he might interest he to look at he perhaps ?
very much so say winston immediately seeing where this tend
some of the new development be most ingenious
the reduction in the number of verb - that be the point that will appeal to he i think
let he see shall i scend a messenger to he with the dictionary ?
but i be afraid i invariably forget anything of that kind
perhaps he could pick he up at he flat at some time that suit he ?
wait
let he give he he address
he be standing in front of a telescreen
somewhat absent-mindedly o'brien feel two of he pocket and then produce a small leather-cover notebook and a gold ink-pencil
immediately beneath the telescreen in such a position that anyone who be watch at the other end of the instrument could read what he be writing he scribble an address tear out the page and hand he to winston
i be usually at home in the evenings he say
if not he servant will give he the dictionary
he be go leave winston holding the scrap of paper which this time there be no need to conceal
nevertheless he carefully memorize what be write on he and some hours later drop he into the memory hole along with a mass of other paper
he have be talk to one another for a couple of minutes at the most
there be only one meaning that the episode could possibly have
he have be contrived as a way of let winston know o'brien have address
this be necessary because except by direct enquiry he be never possible to discover where anyone live
there be no directory of any kind
if he ever want to see he this be where i can be found be what o'brien have be saying to he
perhaps there would even be a message conceal somewhere in the dictionary
but at any rate one thing be certain
the conspiracy that he have dream of do exist and he have reach the outer edge of he
he know that sooner or later he would obey o'brien have summons
perhaps tomorrow perhaps after a long delay - he be not certain
what be happening be only the working-out of a process that have start year ago
the first step have be a secret involuntary think the second have be the opening of the diary
he have move from thought to word and now from word to action
the last step be something that would happen in the ministry of love
he have accepted he
the end be contain in the beginning
but he be frighten : or more exactly he be like a foretaste of death like be a little less alive
even while he be speaking to o'brien when the meaning of the word have sunk in a chilly shudder feeling have take possession of he body
he have the sensation of step into the dampness of a grave and he be not much good because he have always known that the grave be there and wait for he
winston have wake up with he eyes full of tears
julia roll sleepily against he murmur something that might have be what have the matter ?
i dream - he begin and stopped short
he be too complex to be put into word
there be the dream himself and there be a memory connected with he that have swim into he mind in the few second after wake
he lay back with he eyes shut still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream
he be a vast luminous dream in which he whole life seem to stretch out before he like a landscape on a summer evening after rain
he have all occur inside the glass paper-weight but the surface of the glass be the dome of the sky and inside the dome everything be flood with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distance
the dream have also be comprehend by - indeed in some sense he have consist in - a gesture of the arm make by he mother and make again thirty year later by the jewish woman he have see on the news film trying to shelter the small boy from the bullet before the helicopter blow them both to piece
do he know he say that until this moment i believe i have murder he mother ?
why do he murder he ?
say julia almost asleep
i do murder he
not physically
in the dream he have remember he last glimpse of he mother and within a few moment of wake the cluster of small event surround he have all come back
he be a memory that he musth have deliberately pushed out of he consciousness over many year
he be not certain of the date but he could not have be less than ten year old possibly twelve when he have happen
he father have disappear some time earlier how much earlier he could not remember
he remember good the rackety uneasy circumstance of the time : the periodical panic about air-raid and the shelter in tube station the piles of rubble everywhere the unintelligible proclamation post at street corner the gangue of youth in shirt all the same colour the enormous queue outside the bakery the intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance - above all the fact that there be never enough to eat
he remember long afternoons spend with other boy in scrounge round dustbin and rubbish heap pick out the rib of cabbage leave potato peeling sometimes even scrap of stale breadcrust from which he carefully scrape away the cinder ; and also in wait for the passing of truck which travelled over a certain route and be known to carry cattle feed and which when he jolt over the bad patch in the road sometimes spill a few fragment of oil-cake
when he father disappear he mother do not show any surprise or any violent grief but a sudden change came over he
he seem to have become completely spiritless
he be evident even to winston that he be wait for something that he know musth happen
he do everything that be need - cook washed mend make the bed sweep the floor dust the mantelpiece - always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion like an artist have lay-figure moving of he own accord
he large shapely body seem to relapse naturally into stillness
for hours at a time he would sit almost immobile on the bed nurse he young sister a tiny ailing very silent child of two or three with a face make simian by thinness
very occasionally he would take winston in he arms and press he against he for a long time without saying anything
he be aware in spite of he youthfulness and selfishness that this be somehow connected with the never-mention thing that be about to happen
he remember the room where he live a dark closesmelling room that seem half fill by a bed with a white counterpane
there be a gas ring in the fender and a shelf where food be keep and on the landing outside there be a brown earthenware sink common to several room
he remember he mother have statuesque body bend over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan
above all he remember he continuous hunger and the fierce sordid battle at mealtime
he would ask he mother naggingly over and over again why there be not more food he would shout and storm at he ( he even remember the tone of he voice which be beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boom in a peculiar way ) or he would attempt a snivel note of pathos in he effort to get more than he share
he mother be quite ready to give he more than he share
he take he for grant that he the boy should have the big portion ; but however much he give he he invariably demand more
at every meal he would beseech he not to be selfish and to remember that he little sister be sick and also need food but he be no use
he would cry out with rage when he stopped ladle he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of he hands he would grab bit from he sister have plate
he know that he be starve the other two but he could not help he ; he even feel that he have a right to do he
the clamorous hunger in he belly seem to justify he
between meal if he mother do not stand guard he be constantly pilfer at the wretched store of food on the shelf
one day a chocolate-ration be issue
there have be no such issue for week or month past
he remember quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate
he be a two-ounce slab ( he still talk about ounce in those days ) between the three of them
he be obvious that he aught to be divided into three equal parts
suddenly as though he be listen to somebody else winston hear himself demanding in a loud boom voice that he should be give the whole piece
he mother tell he not to be greedy
there be a long nag argument that go round and round with shout whine tears remonstrance bargainings
he tiny sister cling to he mother with both hands exactly like a baby monkey sit look over he shoulder at he with large mournful eyes
in the end he mother break off three-quarters of the chocolate and give he to winston give the other quarter to he sister
the little girl take hold of he and look at he dully perhaps not knowing what he be
winston stand watch he for a moment
then with a sudden swift spring he have snatch the piece of chocolate out of he sister have hand and be flee for the door
winston winston ! he mother call after he
come back !
give he sister back he chocolate !
he stopped but do not come back
he mother have anxious eyes be fixed on he face
even now he be thinking about the thing he do not know what he be that be on the point of happening
he sister conscious of have be rob of something have set up a feeble wail
he mother draw he arm round the child and press he face against he breast
something in the gesture tell he that he sister be dye
he turn and flee down the stairs with the chocolate grow sticky in he hand
he never saw he mother again
after he have devour the chocolate he feel somewhat ashamed of himself and hang about in the street for several hours until hunger drive he home
when he came back he mother have disappear
this be already becoming normal at that time
nothing be go from the room except he mother and he sister
he have not take any clothes not even he mother have overcoat
to this day he do not know with any certainty that he mother be dead
he be perfectly possible that he have merely be send to a forced-labor camp
as for he sister he might have be removed like winston himself to one of the colony for homeless child ( reclamation center he be call ) which have grown up as a result of the civil war or he might have be send to the labor camp along with he mother or simply left somewhere or other to die
the dream be still vivid in he mind especially the envelop protect gesture of the arm in which he whole meaning seem to be contain
he mind go back to another dream of two month ago
exactly as he mother have sit on the dingy whitequilted bed with the child cling to he so he have sit in the sink ship far underneath he and drown deep every minute but still look up at he through the darken water
he tell julia the storey of he mother have disappearance
without opening he eyes he roll over and settle himself into a more comfortable position
i expect he be a beastly little swine in those days he say indistinctly
all child be swine
yes
but the real point of the storey -
from he breathing he be evident that he be going off to sleep again
he would have like to continue talk about he mother
he do not suppose from what he could remember of he that he have be an unusual woman still less an intelligent one ; and yet he have possessed a kind of nobility a kind of purity simply because the standard that he obey be private one
he feeling be he own and could not be alter from outside
he would not have occur to he that an action which be ineffectual thereby become meaningless
if he love someone he love he and when he have nothing else to give he still give he love
when the last of the chocolate be go he mother have clasp the child in he arms
he be no use he change nothing he do not produce more chocolate he do not avert the child have death or he own ; but he seem natural to he to do he
the refugee woman in the boat have also cover the little boy with he arm which be no more use against the bullet than a sheet of paper
the terrible thing that the party have done be to persuade he that mere impulse mere feeling be of no account while at the same time rob he of all power over the material world
when once he be in the grippe of the party what he feel or do not feel what he do or refrain from doing make literally no difference
whatever happen he vanish and neither he nor he action be ever hear of again
he be lift clean out of the stream of history
and yet to the people of only two generation ago this would not have seem all-important because he be not attempt to alter history
he be govern by private loyalty which he do not question
what matter be individual relationship and a completely helpless gesture an embrace a tear a word speak to a dye man could have value in himself
the prole he suddenly occur to he have remain in this condition
he be not loyal to a party or a country or an idea he be loyal to one another
for the first time in he life he do not despise the prole or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world
the prole have stay human
he have not become hardened inside
he have hold on to the primitive emotion which he himself have to re-learn by conscious effort
and in thinking this he remember without apparent relevance how a few week ago he have see a sever hand lie on the pavement and have kick he into the gutter as though he have be a cabbage-stalk
the prole be human being he say aloud
he be not human
why not ?
say julia who have wake up again
he think for a little while
have he ever occur to he he say that the good thing for he to do would be simply to walk out of here before he have too late and never see each other again ?
yes dear he have occur to he several time
but i be not going to do he all the same
he have be lucky he say but he can last much longer
he be young
he look normal and innocent
if he keep clear of people like he he might stay alive for another fifty year
no
i have think he all out
what he do i be going to do
and do be too downhearted
i be rather good at stay alive
he may be together for another six month - a year - there have no knowing
at the end he be certain to be apart
do he realize how utterly alone he shall be ?
when once he get hold of he there will be nothing literally nothing that either of he can do for the other
if i confess he will shoot he and if i refuse to confess he will shoot he just the same
nothing that i can do or say or stop himself from saying will put off he death for as much as five minutes
neither of he will even know whether the other be alive or dead
he shall be utterly without power of any kind
the one thing that matter be that he should betray one another although even that can make the slight difference
if he mean confess he say he shall do that right enough
everybody always confess
he can help he
he torture he
i do mean confess
confession be not betrayal
what he say or do do matter : only feeling matter
if he could make he stop loving he - that would be the real betrayal
he think he over
he can do that he say finally
he have the one thing he can do
he can make he say anything - anything - but he can make he believe he
he can get inside he
no he say a little more hopefully no ; that have quite true
he can get inside he
if he can feel that stay human be worth while even when he can have any result whatever he have beat them
he think of the telescreen with he never-sleep ear
he could spy upon he night and day but if he keep he head he could still outwit them
with all he cleverness he have never master the secret of finding out what another human be be thinking
perhaps that be less true when he be actually in he hands
one do not know what happen inside the ministry of love but he be possible to guess : torture drug delicate instrument that register he nervous reaction gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning
facts at any rate could not be keep hide
he could be track down by enquiry he could be squeeze out of he by torture
but if the object be not to stay alive but to stay human what difference do he ultimately make ?
he could not alter he feeling : for that matter he could not alter them himself even if he want to
he could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that he have done or say or think ; but the inner heart who working be mysterious even to himself remain impregnable
he have done he he have done he at last !
the room he be standing in be long-shape and softly light
the telescreen be dim to a low murmur ; the richness of the dark-blue carpet give one the impression of tread on velvet
at the far end of the room o'brien be sitting at a table under a green-shade lamp with a mass of paper on either side of he
he have not bother to look up when the servant show julia and winston in
winston have heart be thumping so hard that he doubt whether he would be able to speak
he have done he he have done he at last be all he could think
he have be a rash act to come here at all and sheer folly to arrive together ; though he be true that he have come by different route and only meet on o'brien have doorstep
but merely to walk into such a place need an effort of the nerve
he be only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-place of the inner party or even penetrate into the quarter of the town where he live
the whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats the richness and spaciousness of everything the unfamiliar smell of good food and good tobacco the silent and incredibly rapid lift sliding up and down the white-jacketed servant hurry to and fro - everything be intimidate
although he have a good pretext for coming here he be haunted at every step by the fear that a black-uniform guard would suddenly appear from round the corner demand he paper and order he to get out
o'brien have servant however have admit the two of them without demur
he be a small dark man in a white jacket with a diamond-shape completely expressionless face which might have be that of a chinese
the passage down which he lead them be softly carpet with cream-paper wall and white wainscot all exquisitely clean
that too be intimidate
winston could not remember ever to have see a passageway who wall be not grimy from the contact of human body
o'brien have a slip of paper between he finger and seem to be study he intently
he heavy face bent down so that one could see the line of the nose look both formidable and intelligent
for perhaps twenty second he sit without stirring
then he pull the speakwrite towards he and rap out a message in the hybrid jargon of the ministry :
item one comma five comma seven approve fullwise stop suggestion contain item six doubleplus ridiculous verge crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimate machinery overheads stop end message
he rose deliberately from he chair and came towards them across the soundless carpet
a little of the official atmosphere seem to have fall away from he with the newspeak word but he expression be grim than usual as though he be not please at be disturbed
the terror that winston already feel be suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment
he seem to he quite possible that he have simply make a stupid mistake
for what evidence have he in reality that o'brien be any kind of political conspirator ?
nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remarque : beyond that only he own secret imaginings found on a dream
he could not even fall back on the pretence that he have come to borrow the dictionary because in that case julia have presence be impossible to explain
as o'brien pass the telescreen a think seem to strike he
he stopped turn aside and press a switch on the wall
there be a sharp snap
the voice have stopped
julia utter a tiny sound a sort of squeak of surprise
even in the midst of he panic winston be too much take aback to be able to hold he tongue
he can turn he off ! he say
yes say o'brien he can turn he off
he have that privilege
he be opposite them now
he solid forme towered over the pair of them and the expression on he face be still indecipherable
he be wait somewhat sternly for winston to speak but about what ?
even now he be quite conceivable that he be simply a busy man wonder irritably why he have be interrupted
nobody spoke
after the stopping of the telescreen the room seem deadly silent
the second march past enormous
with difficulty winston continue to keep he eyes fixed on o'brien have
then suddenly the grim face break down into what might have be the beginning of a smile
with he characteristic gesture o'brien resettle he spectacles on he nose
shall i say he or will he ?
he say
i will say he say winston promptly
that thing be really turn off ?
yes everything be turn off
he be alone
he have come here because -
he pause realize for the first time the vagueness of he own motive
since he do not in fact know what kind of help he expect from o'brien he be not easy to say why he have come here
he go on conscious that what he be saying musth sound both feeble and pretentious :
he believe that there be some kind of conspiracy some kind of secret organization working against the party and that he be involved in he
he want to join he and work for he
he be enemy of the party
he disbelieve in the principle of ingsoc
he be think-criminal
he be also adulterer
i tell he this because he want to put himself at he mercy
if he want he to incriminate himself in any other way he be ready
he stopped and glance over he shoulder with the feeling that the door have open
sure enough the little yellow-face servant have come in without knock
winston saw that he be carry a tray with a decanter and glasses
martin be one of he say o'brien impassively
bring the drink over here martin
put them on the round table
have he enough chair ?
then he may as well sit down and talk in comfort
bring a chair for himself martin
this be business
he can stop be a servant for the next ten minutes
the little man sit down quite at he ease and yet still with a servant-like air the air of a valet enjoy a privilege
winston regard he out of the corner of he eye
he strike he that the man have whole life be play a part and that he feel he to be dangerous to drop he assumed personality even for a moment
o'brien take the decanter by the neck and fill up the glasses with a dark-red liquid
he arouse in winston dim memory of something see long ago on a wall or a hoarding - a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seem to move up and down and pour he content into a glass
see from the top the stuff look almost black but in the decanter he gleam like a ruby
he have a sour-sweet smell
he saw julia pick up he glass and sniff at he with frank curiosity
he be call wine say o'brien with a faint smile
he will have read about he in book no doubt
not much of he get to the outer party i be afraid
he face grow solemn again and he raise he glass : i think he be fitting that he should begin by drink a health
to he leader : to emmanuel goldstein
winston take up he glass with a certain eagerness
wine be a thing he have read and dream about
like the glass paper-weight or mr charrington have half-remember rhyme he belong to the vanish romantic past the olden time as he like to call he in he secret thought
for some reason he have always think of wine as have an intensely sweet taste like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicate effect
actually when he came to swallow he the stuff be distinctly disappoint
the truth be that after year of gin-drink he could barely taste he
he set down the empty glass
then there be such a person as goldstein ?
he say
yes there be such a person and he be alive
where i do not know
and the conspiracy - the organization ?
be he real ?
he be not simply an invention of the think police ?
no he be real
the brotherhood he call he
he will never learn much more about the brotherhood than that he exist and that he belong to he
i will come back to that presently
he look at he wrist-watch
he be unwise even for member of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour
he aught not to have come here together and he will have to leave separately
he comrade - he bow he head to julia - will leave first
he have about twenty minutes at he disposal
he will understand that i musth start by ask he certain question
in general terms what be he prepare to do ?
anything that he be capable of say winston
o'brien have turn himself a little in he chair so that he be facing winston
he almost ignore julia seeming to take he for grant that winston could speak for he
for a moment the lid flit down over he eyes
he begin ask he question in a low expressionless voice as though this be a routine a sort of catechism most of who answer be known to he already
he be prepare to give he live ?
yes
he be prepare to commit murder ?
yes
to commit act of sabotage which may cause the death of hundred of innocent people ?
yes
to betray he country to foreign power ?
yes
he be prepare to cheat to forge to blackmail to corrupt the mind of child to distribute habit-forming drug to encourage prostitution to disseminate venereal disease - to do anything which be likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the party ?
yes
if for example he would somehow serve he interest to throw sulphuric acid in a child have face - be he prepare to do that ?
yes
he be prepare to lose he identity and live out the rest of he life as a waiter or a dock-worker ?
yes
he be prepare to commit suicide if and when he order he to do so ?
yes
he be prepare the two of he to separate and never see one another again ?
no ! break in julia
he appear to winston that a long time pass before he answer
for a moment he seem even to have be deprived of the power of speech
he tongue worked soundlessly form the opening syllable first of one word then of the other over and over again
until he have say he he do not know which word he be going to say
no he say finally
he do well to tell he say o'brien
he be necessary for he to know everything
he turn himself toward julia and add in a voice with somewhat more expression in he :
do he understand that even if he survive he may be as a different person ?
he may be oblige to give he a new identity
he face he movement the shape of he hands the colour of he hair - even he voice would be different
and he himself might have become a different person
he surgeon can alter people beyond recognition
sometimes he be necessary
sometimes he even amputate a limb
winston could not help snatch another sidelong glance at martin have mongolism face
there be no scar that he could see
julia have turn a shade pale so that he freckle be showing but he face o'brien boldly
he murmur something that seem to be assent
good
then that be settle
there be a silver box of cigarette on the table
with a rather absent-minded air o'brien pushed them towards the other take one himself then stand up and begin to pace slowly to and fro as though he could think good standing
he be very good cigarette very thick and well-pack with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper
o'brien look at he wrist-watch again
he have good go back to he pantry martin he say
i shall switch on in a quarter of an hour
take a good look at these comrade face before he go
he will be seeing them again
i may not
exactly as he have done at the front door the little man have dark eyes flicker over he face
there be not a trace of friendliness in he manner
he be memorize he appearance but he feel no interest in them or appear to feel none
he occur to winston that a synthetic face be perhaps incapable of change he expression
without speaking or give any kind of salutation martin go out close the door silently behind he
o'brien be stroll up and down one hand in the pocket of he black overall the other holding he cigarette
he understand he say that he will be fight in the dark
he will always be in the dark
he will receive order and he will obey them without knowing why
later i shall scend he a book from which he will learn the true nature of the society he live in and the strategy by which he shall destroy he
when he have read the book he will be full member of the brotherhood
but between the general aim that he be fight for and the immediate task of the moment he will never know anything
i tell he that the brotherhood exist but i can tell he whether he number a hundred member or ten million
from he personal knowledge he will never be able to say that he number even as many as a dozen
he will have three or four contact who will be renew from time to time as he disappear
as this be he first contact he will be preserve
when he receive order he will come from he
if he find he necessary to communicate with he he will be through martin
when he be finally catch he will confess
that be unavoidable
but he will have very little to confess other than he own action
he will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people
probably he will not even betray he
by that time i may be dead or i shall have become a different person with a different face
he continue to move to and fro over the soft carpet
in spite of the bulkiness of he body there be a remarkable grace in he movement
he came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into he pocket or manipulate a cigarette
more even than of strength he give an impression of confidence and of an understanding ting by irony
however much in earnest he might be he have nothing of the single-mindedness that belong to a fanatic
when he spoke of murder suicide venereal disease amputate limb and alter face he be with a faint air of persiflage
this be unavoidable he voice seem to say ; this be what he have get to do unflinchingly
but this be not what he shall be doing when life be worth living again
a wave of admiration almost of worship flow out from winston towards o'brien
for the moment he have forget the shadowy figure of goldstein
when he look at o'brien have powerful shoulder and he blunt-feature face so ugly and yet so civilized he be impossible to believe that he could be defeat
there be no stratagem that he be not equal to no danger that he could not foresee
even julia seem to be impress
he have let he cigarette go out and be listen intently
o'brien go on :
he will have hear rumour of the existence of the brotherhood
no doubt he have form he own picture of he
he have imagine probably a huge underworld of conspirator meeting secretly in cellar scribble message on wall recognize one another by codewords or by special movement of the hand
nothing of the kind exist
the member of the brotherhood have no way of recognize one another and he be impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few other
goldstein himself if he fell into the hands of the think police could not give them a complete list of member or any information that would lead them to a complete list
no such list exist
the brotherhood can be wipe out because he be not an organization in the ordinary sense
nothing hold he together except an idea which be indestructible
he will never have anything to sustain he except the idea
he will get no comradeship and no encouragement
when finally he be catch he will get no help
he never help he member
at most when he be absolutely necessary that someone should be silence he be occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner have cell
he will have to get used to living without result and without hope
he will work for a while he will be catch he will confess and then he will die
those be the only result that he will ever see
there be no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within he own lifetime
he be the dead
he only true life be in the future
he shall take part in he as handful of dust and splinter of bone
but how far away that future may be there be no knowing
he might be a thousand year
at present nothing be possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little
he can act collectively
he can only spread he knowledge outward from individual to individual generation after generation
in the face of the think police there be no other way
he halt and look for the third time at he wrist-watch
he be almost time for he to leave comrade he say to julia
wait
the decanter be still half full
he fill the glasses and raise he own glass by the stem
what shall he be this time ?
he say still with the same faint suggestion of irony
to the confusion of the think police ?
to the death of big brother ?
to humanity ?
to the future ?
to the past say winston
the past be more important agreed o'brien gravely
he empty he glasses and a moment later julia stand up to go
o'brien take a small box from the top of a cabinet and hand he a flat white tablet which he tell he to place on he tongue
he be important he say not to go out smell of wine : the lift attendant be very observant
as soon as the door have shut behind he he appear to forget he existence
he take another pace or two up and down then stopped
there be detail to be settle he say
i assume that he have a hiding-place of some kind ?
winston explain about the room over mr charrington have shop
that will do for the moment
later he will arrange something else for he
he be important to change one have hiding-place frequently
meanwhile i shall scend he a copy of the book - even o'brien winston notice seem to pronounce the word as though he be in italic - goldstein have book he understand as soon as possible
he may be some days before i can get hold of one
there be not many in existence as he can imagine
the think police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as he can produce them
he make very little difference
the book be indestructible
if the last copy be go he could reproduce he almost word for word
do he carry a brief-case to work with he ?
he add
as a rule yes
what be he like ?
black very shabby
with two strap
black two strap very shabby - good
one day in the fairly near future - i can give a date - one of the message amongst he morning have work will contain a misprint word and he will have to ask for a repeat
on the following day he will go to work without he brief-case
at some time during the day in the street a man will touch he on the arm and say i think he have drop he brief-case
the one he give he will contain a copy of goldstein have book
he will return he within fourteen days
he be silent for a moment
there be a couple of minutes before he need go say o'brien
he shall meet again - if he do meet again -
winston look up at he
in the place where there be no darkness ?
he say hesitantly
o'brien nod without appearance of surprise
in the place where there be no darkness he say as though he have recognize the allusion
and in the meantime be there anything that he wish to say before he leave ?
any message ?
any question ?
winston think
there do not seem to be any further question that he want to ask : still less do he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding generality
instead of anything directly connected with o'brien or the brotherhood there came into he mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where he mother have spend he last days and the little room over mr charrington have shop and the glass paper-weight and the steel engraving in he rosewood frame
almost at random he say :
do he ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begin orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have ?
again o'brien nod
with a sort of grave courtesy he complete the stanza :
orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
he owe he three farthing say the bell of st martin have
when will he pay he ? say the bell of old bailey
when i grow rich say the bell of shoreditch
he know the last line ! say winston
yes i know the last line
and now i be afraid he be time for he to go
but wait
he have good let he give he one of these tablet
as winston stand up o'brien hold out a hand
he powerful grippe crush the bone of winston have palm
at the door winston look back but o'brien seem already to be in process of putt he out of mind
he be wait with he hand on the switch that control the telescreen
beyond he winston could see the writing-table with he green-shade lamp and the speakwrite and the wire basket deep-lade with paper
the incident be closed
within thirty second he occur to he o'brien would be back at he interrupted and important work on behalf of the party
winston be gelatinous with fatigue
gelatinous be the right word
he have come into he head spontaneously
he body seem to have not only the weakness of a jelly but he translucence
he feel that if he hold up he hand he would be able to see the light through he
all the blood and lymph have be drain out of he by an enormous debauch of work leave only a frail structure of nerves bone and skin
all sensation seem to be magnify
he overall fretted he shoulder the pavement tickle he foot even the opening and close of a hand be an effort that make he joint creak
he have worked more than ninety hours in five days
so have everyone else in the ministry
now he be all over and he have literally nothing to do no party work of any description until tomorrow morning
he could spend six hours in the hiding-place and another nine in he own bed
slowly in mild afternoon sunshine he walk up a dingy street in the direction of mr charrington have shop keeping one eye open for the patrol but irrationally convince that this afternoon there be no danger of anyone interfere with he
the heavy brief-case that he be carry bump against he knee at each step scend a tingle sensation up and down the skin of he leg
inside he be the book which he have now have in he possession for six days and have not yet open nor even look at
on the sixth day of hate week after the procession the speech the shout the sing the banner the poster the film the waxwork the rolling of drum and squeal of trumpet the tramp of march foot the grind of the caterpillar of tank the roar of mass plane the boom of gun - after six days of this when the great orgasm be quiver to he climax and the general hatred of eurasia have boil up into such delirium that if the crowd could have get he hands on the 2 000 eurasian war-criminal who be to be publicly hang on the last day of the proceeding he would unquestionably have tear them to piece - at just this moment he have be announce that oceania be not after all at war with eurasia
oceania be at war with eastasia
eurasia be an ally
there be of course no admission that any change have take place
merely he become known with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once that eastasia and not eurasia be the enemy
winston be taking part in a demonstration in one of the central london square at the moment when he happen
he be night and the white face and the scarlet banner be luridly floodlight
the square be pack with several thousand people include a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the spy
on a scarlet-drape platform an orator of the inner party a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank lock straggle be harangue the crowd
a little rumpelstiltskin figure contorted with hatred he grip the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other enormous at the end of a bony arm claw the air menacingly above he head
he voice make metallic by the amplifier boom forth an endless catalogue of atrocity massacre deportation lootings rapings torture of prisoner bomb of civilian lie propaganda unjust aggression break treaty
he be almost impossible to listen to he without be first convince and then madden
at every few moment the fury of the crowd boil over and the voice of the speaker be drown by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousand of throat
the most savage yell of all came from the schoolchildren
the speech have be proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper be slip into the speaker have hand
he unroll and read he without pause in he speech
nothing alter in he voice or manner or in the content of what he be saying but suddenly the name be different
without word say a wave of understanding ripple through the crowd
oceania be at war with eastasia !
the next moment there be a tremendous commotion
the banner and poster with which the square be decorate be all wrong !
quite half of them have the wrong face on them
he be sabotage !
the agent of goldstein have be at work !
there be a riotous interlude while poster be rip from the wall banner tear to shred and trample underfoot
the spy perform prodigy of activity in clamber over the rooftops and cutting the streamer that flutter from the chimney
but within two or three minutes he be all over
the orator still grip the neck of the microphone he shoulder hunch forward he free hand claw at the air have go straight on with he speech
one minute more and the feral roar of rage be again burst from the crowd
the hate continue exactly as before except that the target have be change
the thing that impress winston in look back be that the speaker have switch from one line to the other actually in midsentence not only without a pause but without even breaking the syntax
but at the moment he have other thing to preoccupy he
he be during the moment of disorder while the poster be be tear down that a man who face he do not see have tap he on the shoulder and say excuse he i think he have drop he brief-case
he take the brief-case abstractedly without speaking
he know that he would be days before he have an opportunity to look inside he
the instant that the demonstration be over he go straight to the ministry of truth though the time be now nearly twenty-three hours
the entire staff of the ministry have done likewise
the order already issue from the telescreen recall them to he post be hardly necessary
oceania be at war with eastasia : oceania have always be at war with eastasia
a large part of the political literature of five year be now completely obsolete
report and record of all kind newspaper book pamphlet film sound-track photograph - all have to be rectify at lightning speed
although no directive be ever issue he be known that the chief of the department intended that within one week no reference to the war with eurasia or the alliance with eastasia should remain in existence anywhere
the work be overwhelming all the more so because the process that he involved could not be call by he true name
everyone in the record department worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four with two three-hour snatch of sleep
mattress be bring up from the cellar and pitch all over the corridor : meal consist of sandwich and victory coffee wheeled round on trolley by attendant from the canteen
each time that winston break off for one of he spell of sleep he try to leave he desk clear of work and each time that he crawl back sticky-eyed and ache he be to find that another shower of paper cylinder have cover the desk like a snowdrift halfburying the speakwrite and overflow on to the floor so that the first job be always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give he room to work
what be bad of all be that the work be by no means purely mechanical
often he be enough merely to substitute one name for another but any detailed report of event demand care and imagination
even the geographical knowledge that one need in transfer the war from one part of the world to another be considerable
by the third day he eyes ache unbearably and he spectacles need wipe every few minutes
he be like struggle with some crush physical task something which one have the right to refuse and which one be nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish
in so far as he have time to remember he he be not trouble by the fact that every word he murmur into the speakwrite every stroke of he ink-pencil be a deliberate lie
he be as anxious as anyone else in the department that the forgery should be perfect
on the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinder slow down
for as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube ; then one more cylinder then nothing
everywhere at about the same time the work be ease off
a deep and as he be secret sigh go through the department
a mighty deed which could never be mention have be achieve
he be now impossible for any human be to prove by documentary evidence that the war with eurasia have ever happen
at twelve hundred he be unexpectedly announce that all worker in the ministry be free till tomorrow morning
winston still carry the brief-case contain the book which have remain between he foot while he worked and under he body while he sleep go home shave himself and almost fell asleep in he bath although the water be barely more than tepid
with a sort of voluptuous creak in he joint he climb the stair above mr charrington have shop
he be tire but not sleepy any longer
he open the window light the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee
julia would arrive presently : meanwhile there be the book
he sit down in the sluttish armchair and undo the strap of the brief-case
a heavy black volume amateurishly bound with no name or title on the cover
the print also look slightly irregular
the page be wear at the edge and fell apart easily as though the book have pass through many hands
the inscription on the title-page run :
the theory and practic of oligarchic collectivism by emmanuel goldstein
winston begin reading :
chapter i
ignorance be strength
throughout record time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have be three kind of people in the world the high the middle and the low
he have be subdivide in many way he have bear countless different name and he relative number as well as he attitude towards one another have varied from age to age : but the essential structure of society have never alter
even after enormous upheaval and seemingly irrevocable change the same pattern have always reassert himself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far he be pushed one way or the other
the aim of these group be entirely irreconcilable .
winston stopped reading chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he be reading in comfort and safety
he be alone : no telescreen no ear at the keyhole no nervous impulse to glance over he shoulder or cover the page with he hand
the sweet summer air play against he cheek
from somewhere far away there float the faint shout of child : in the room himself there be no sound except the insect voice of the clock
he settle deep into the arm-chair and put he foot up on the fender
he be bliss he be eternity
suddenly as one sometimes do with a book of which one know that one will ultimately read and re-read every word he open he at a different place and found himself at chapter iii
he go on reading :
chapter iii
war be peace
the splitting up of the world into three great super-state be an event which could be and indeed be foresee before the middle of the twentieth century
with the absorptance of europe by russia and of the british empire by the united state two of the three exist power eurasia and oceania be already effectively in be
the third eastasia only emerge as a distinct unit after another decade of confuse fight
the frontier between the three super-state be in some place arbitrary and in other he fluctuate according to the fortune of war but in general he follow geographical lines
eurasia comprise the whole of the northern part of the european and asiatic land-mass from portugal to the bering strait
oceania comprise the americas the atlantic island include the british isle australasia and the southern portion of africa
eastasia small than the other and with a less definite western frontier comprise china and the country to the south of he the japanese island and a large but fluctuate portion of manchuria mongolia and tibet
in one combination or another these three super-state be permanently at war and have be so for the past twenty-five year
war however be no longer the desperate annihilate struggle that he be in the early decade of the twentieth centary
he be a warfare of limited aim between combatant who be unable to destroy one another have no material cause for fight and be not divided by any genuine ideological difference
this be not to say that either the conduct of war or the prevailing attitude towards he have become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous
on the contrary war hysteria be continuous and universal in all country and such act as rape loot the slaughter of child the reduction of whole population to slavery and reprisal against prisoner which extend even to boiling and bury alive be look upon as normal and when he be commit by one have own side and not by the enemy meritorious
but in a physical sense war involve very small number of people mostly highly-train specialist and cause comparatively few casualty
the fight when there be any take place on the vague frontier who whereabouts the average man can only guess at or round the floating fortress which guard strategic spot on the sea lane
in the center of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few score of death
war have in fact change he character
more exactly the reason for which war be wage have change in he order of importance
motive which be already present to some small extent in the great war of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and be consciously recognize and act upon
to understand the nature of the present war - for in spite of the regroup which occur every few year he be always the same war - one musth realize in the first place that he be impossible for he to be decisive
none of the three super-state could be definitively conquer even by the other two in combination
he be too evenly match and he natural defence be too formidable
eurasia be protect by he vast land space
oceania by the width of the atlantic and the pacific eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of he inhabitant
secondly there be no longer in a material sense anything to fight about
with the establishment of self-contained economy in which production and consumption be gear to one another the scramble for market which be a main cause of previous war have come to an end while the competition for raw materials be no longer a matter of life and death
in any case each of the three super-state be so vast that he can obtain almost all the materials that he needs within he own boundary
in so far as the war have a direct economic purpose he be a war for labor power
between the frontier of the super-state and not permanently in the possession of any of them there lie a rough quadrilateral with he corner at tangy brazzaville darwin and hong kong contain within he about a fifth of the population of the earth
he be for the possession of these thickly-populate region and of the northern ice-cap that the three power be constantly struggle
in practice no one power ever control the whole of the dispute area
portion of he be constantly change hands and he be the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictate the endless change of alignment
all of the dispute territory contain valuable mineral and some of them yield important vegetable product such as rubber which in cold climate he be necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive method
but above all he contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labor
whichever power control equatorial africa or the country of the middle east or southern india or the indonesian archipelago dispose also of the body of score or hundred of million of ill-pay and hard-working coolie
the inhabitant of these area reduce more or less openly to the status of slave pass continually from conqueror to conqueror and be expend like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armament to capture more territory to control more labor power to turn out more armament to capture more territory and so on indefinitely
he should be noted that the fight never really move beyond the edge of the dispute area
the frontier of eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the congou and the northern shore of the mediterranean ; the island of the indian ocean and the pacific be constantly be capture and recapture by oceania or by eastasia ; in mongolia the divide line between eurasia and eastasia be never stable ; round the pole all three power lay claim to enormous territory which in fact be largely uninhabited and unexplored : but the balance of power always remains roughly even and the territory which forme the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate
moreover the labor of the exploit people round the equator be not really necessary to the world have economy
he add nothing to the wealth of the world since whatever he produce be used for purpose of war and the object of wage a war be always to be in a good position in which to wage another war
by he labor the slave population allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speed up
but if he do not exist the structure of world society and the process by which he maintain himself would not be essentially different
the primary aim of modern warfare ( in accordance with the principle of double-think this aim be simultaneously recognize and not recognize by the direct brain of the inner party ) be to use up the product of the machine without raising the general standard of living
ever since the end of the nineteenth century the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods have be latent in industrial society
at present when few human being even have enough to eat this problem be obviously not urgent and he might not have become so even if no artificial process of destruction have be at work
the world of today be a bare hungry dilapidated place compare with the world that exist before 1914 and still more so if compare with the imaginary future to which the people of that period look forward
in the early twentieth century the vision of a future society unbelievably rich leisured orderly and efficient - a glitter antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete - be part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person
science and technology be develop at a prodigious speed and he seem natural to assume that he would go on develop
this fail to happen partly because of the impoverishment cause by a long series of war and revolution partly because scientific and technical progress depend on the empirical habit of think which could not survive in a strictly regiment society
as a whole the world be more primitive today than he be fifty year ago
certain backward area have advanced and various device always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage have be develop but experiment and invention have largely stopped and the ravage of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifty have never be fully repair
nevertheless the danger inherent in the machine be still there
from the moment when the machine first make he appearance he be clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery and therefore to a great extent for human inequality have disappear
if the machine be used deliberately for that end hunger overwork dirt illiteracy and disease could be eliminate within a few generation
and in fact without be used for any such purpose but by a sort of automatic process - by produce wealth which he be sometimes impossible not to distribute - the machine do raise the living standard of the average humand be very greatly over a period of about fifty year at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century
but he be also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threaten the destruction - indeed in some sense be the destruction - of a hierarchical society
in a world in which everyone worked short hours have enough to eat live in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane the most obvious and perhaps the most important forme of inequality would already have disappear
if he once become general wealth would confer no distinction
he be possible no doubt to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possession and luxury should be evenly distribute while power remain in the hands of a small privileged caste
but in practice such a society could not long remain stable
for if leisure and security be enjoy by all alike the great mass of human being who be normally stupefy by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for himself ; and when once he have done this he would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority have no function and he would sweep he away
in the long run a hierarchical society be only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance
to return to the agricultural past as some thinker about the beginning of the twentieth century dream of doing be not a practicable solution
he conflict with the tendency towards mechanization which have become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world and moreover any country which remain industrially backward be helpless in a military sense and be bound to be dominate directly or indirectly by he more advanced rival
nor be he a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restrict the output of goods
this happen to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism roughly between 1920 and 1940
the economy of many country be allow to stagnate land go out of cultivation capital equipment be not add to great block of the population be prevent from working and keep half alive by state charity
but this too entail military weakness and since the privation he inflict be obviously unnecessary he make opposition inevitable
the problem be how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increase the real wealth of the world
goods musth be produce but he musth not be distribute
and in practice the only way of achieve this be by continuous warfare
the essential act of war be destruction not necessarily of human live but of the product of human labor
war be a way of shatter to piece or pour into the stratosphere or sinking in the depth of the sea materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and hence in the long run too intelligent
even when weapon of war be not actually destroy he manufacture be still a convenient way of expend labor power without produce anything that can be consume
a floating fortress for example have lock up in he the labor that would build several hundred cargo-ship
ultimately he be scrap as obsolete never have bring any material benefit to anybody and with further enormous labour another floating fortress be build
in principle the war effort be always so plan as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population
in practice the needs of the population be always underestimate with the result that there be a chronic shortage of half the necessity of life ; but this be look on as an advantage
he be deliberate policy to keep even the favour group somewhere near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcity increase the importance of small privilege and thus magnify the distinction between one group and another
by the standard of the early twentieth century even a member of the inner party live an austere laborious kind of life
nevertheless the few luxury that he do enjoy he large well-appointed flat the good texture of he clothes the good quality of he food and drink and tobacco he two or three servant he private motor-car or helicopter - set he in a different world from a member of the outer party and the member of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses who he call the prole
the social atmosphere be that of a besiege city where the possession of a lump of horseflesh make the difference between wealth and poverty
and at the same time the consciousness of be at war and therefore in danger make the hand-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural unavoidable condition of survival
war he will be see accomplish the necessary destruction but accomplish he in a psychologically acceptable way
in principle he would be quite simple to waste the surplus labor of the world by building temple and pyramid by dig hole and filling them up again or even by produce vast quantity of goods and then setting fire to them
but this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society
what be concerned here be not the morale of masses who attitude be unimportant so long as he be keep steadily at work but the morale of the party himself
even the humble party member be expect to be competent industrious and even intelligent within narrow limit but he be also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic who prevailing mood be fear hatred adulation and orgiastic triumph
in other word he be necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war
he do not matter whether the war be actually happening and since no decisive victory be possible he do not matter whether the war be going well or badly
all that be need be that a state of war should exist
the splitting of the intelligence which the party require of he member and which be more easily achieve in an atmosphere of war be now almost universal but the high up the rank one go the more marked he become
he be precisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy be strong
in he capacity as an administrator he be often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news be untruthful and he may often be aware that the entire war be spurious and be either not happening or be be wage for purpose quite other than the declare one : but such knowledge be easily neutralize by the technique of double-think
meanwhile no inner party member waver for an instant in he mystical belief that the war be real and that he be bound to end victoriously with oceania the undisputed master of the entire world
all member of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith
he be to be achieve either by gradually acquire more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon
the search for new weapon continue unceasingly and be one of the very few remain activity in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet
in oceania at the present day science in the old sense have almost cease to exist
in newspeak there be no word for science
the empirical method of think on which all the scientific achievement of the past be found be oppose to the most fundamental principle of ingsoc
and even technological progress only happen when he product can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty
in all the useful arts the world be either standing still or going backward
the field be cultivated with horse-plough while book be write by machinery
but in matter of vital importance - meaning in effect war and police espionage - the empirical approach be still encourage or at least tolerate
the two aim of the party be to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent think
there be therefore two great problem which the party be concerned to solve
one be how to discover against he will what another human be be thinking and the other be how to kill several hundred million people in a few second without give warning beforehand
in so far as scientific research still continue this be he subject matter
the scientist of today be either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor study with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expression gesture and tone of voice and test the truth-produce effects of drug shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture ; or he be chemist physicist or biologist concerned only with such branch of he special subject as be relevant to the taking of life
in the vast laboratory of the ministry of peace and in the experimental station hide in the brazilian forest or in the australian desert or on lose island of the antarctic the team of expert be indefatigably at work
some be concerned simply with plan the logistics of future war ; other devise large and large rocket bomb more and more powerful explosive and more and more impenetrable armour-plating ; other search for new and deadly gas or for soluble poison capable of be produce in such quantity as to destroy the vegetation of whole continent or for breed of disease germ immunize against all possible antibody ; other strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore he way under the soil like a submarine under the water or an aeroplane as independent of he base as a sailing-ship ; other explore even remote possibility such as focus the sun have ray through lens suspend thousand of kilometre away in space or produce artificial earthquake and tidal wave by tap the heat at the earth have center
but none of these project ever come anywhere near realization and none of the three super-state ever gains a significant lead on the other
what be more remarkable be that all three power already possess in the atomic bomb a weapon far more powerful than any that he present research be likely to discover
although the party according to he habit claim the invention for himself atomic bomb first appear as early as the nineteen-forty and be first used on a large scale about ten year later
at that time some hundred of bomb be drop on industrial center chiefly in european russia western europe and north america
the effect be to convince the ruling group of all country that a few more atomic bomb would mean the end of organize society and hence of he own power
thereafter although no formal agreement be ever make or hint at no more bomb be drop
all three power merely continue to produce atomic bomb and store them up against the decisive opportunity which he all believe will come sooner or later
and meanwhile the art of war have remain almost stationary for thirty or forty year
helicopter be more used than he be formerly bomb plane have be largely supersede by self-propelled projectile and the fragile movable battleship have give way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress ; but otherwise there have be little development
the tank the submarine the torpedo the machine gun even the rifle and the hand grenade be still in use
and in spite of the endless slaughter report in the press and on the telescreens the desperate battle of earlier war in which hundred of thousand or even million of man be often kill in a few week have never be repeated
none of the three super-state ever attempt any manoeuvre which involve the risk of serious defeat
when any large operation be undertake he be usually a surprise attack against an ally
the strategy that all three power be following or pretend to himself that he be following be the same
the plan be by a combination of fight bargain and well-timed stroke of treachery to acquire a ring of basis completely encircle one or other of the rival state and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many year as to lull suspicion to sleep
during this time rocket loaded with atomic bomb can be assemble at all the strategic spot ; finally he will all be fire simultaneously with effects so devastate as to make retaliation impossible
he will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remain world-power in preparation for another attack
this scheme he be hardly necessary to say be a mere day-dream impossible of realization
moreover no fight ever occur except in the dispute area round the equator and the pole : no invasion of enemy territory be ever undertake
this explain the fact that in some place the frontier between the superstates be arbitrary
eurasia for example could easily conquer the british isle which be geographically part of europe or on the other hand he would be possible for oceania to push he frontier to the rhine or even to the vistula
but this would violate the principle follow on all side though never formulate of cultural integrity
if oceania be to conquer the area that used once to be known as france and germany he would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitant a task of great physical difficulty or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people who so far as technical development go be roughly on the oceanic level
the problem be the same for all three super-state
he be absolutely necessary to he structure that there should be no contact with foreigner except to a limited extent with war prisoner and colored slave
even the official ally of the moment be always regard with the dark suspicion
war prisoner apart the average citizen of oceania never set eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia and he be forbid the knowledge of foreign language
if he be allow contact with foreigner he would discover that he be creature similar to himself and that most of what he have be tell about them be lie
the seal world in which he live would be break and the fear hatred and self-righteousness on which he morale depend might evaporate
he be therefore realize on all side that however often persia or egypt or java or ceylon may change hands the main frontier musth never be cross by anything except bomb
under this lie a fact never mention aloud but tacitly understand and act upon : namely that the condition of life in all three super-state be very much the same
in oceania the prevailing philosophy be call ingsoc in eurasia he be call neo and in eastasia he be call by a chinese name usually translate as death-worship but perhaps good render as obliteration of the self
the citizen of oceania be not allow to know anything of the tenet of the other two philosophies but he be teach to execrate them as barbarous outrage upon morality and common sense
actually the three philosophies be barely distinguishable and the social system which he support be not distinguishable at all
everywhere there be the same pyramidal structure the same worship of semi-divine leader the same economy exist by and for continuous warfare
he follow that the three super-state not only can conquer one another but would gain no advantage by doing so
on the contrary so long as he remain in conflict he prop one another up like three sheave of corn
and as usual the ruling group of all three power be simultaneously aware and unaware of what he be doing
he live be dedicated to world conquest but he also know that he be necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory
meanwhile the fact that there be no danger of conquest make possible the denial of reality which be the special feature of ingsoc and he rival system of think
here he be necessary to repeat what have be say earlier that by becoming continuous war have fundamentally change he character
in past age a war almost by definition be something that sooner or later came to an end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat
in the past also war be one of the main instrument by which human society be keep in touch with physical reality
all ruler in all age have try to impose a false view of the world upon he follower but he could not afford to encourage any illusion that tend to impair military efficiency
so long as defeat mean the loss of independence or some other result generally hold to be undesirable the precaution against defeat have to be serious
physical facts could not be ignore
in philosophy or religion or ethics or politics two and two might make five but when one be designing a gun or an aeroplane he have to make four
inefficient nation be always conquer sooner or later and the struggle for efficiency be inimical to illusion
moreover to be efficient he be necessary to be able to learn from the past which mean have a fairly accurate idea of what have happen in the past
newspaper and history book be of course always colored and biased but falsification of the kind that be practise today would have be impossible
war be a sure safeguard of sanity and so far as the ruling classis be concerned he be probably the most important of all safeguard
while war could be win or lose no ruling class could be completely irresponsible
but when war become literally continuous he also cease to be dangerous
when war be continuous there be no such thing as military necessity
technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be deny or disregard
as he have see research that could be call scientific be still carry out for the purpose of war but he be essentially a kind of daydream and he failure to show result be not important
efficiency even military efficiency be no longer need
nothing be efficient in oceania except the think police
since each of the three super-state be unconquerable each be in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of think can be safely practise
reality only exert he pressure through the needs of everyday life - the need to eat and drink to get shelter and clothing to avoid swallow poison or step out of top-storey window and the like
between life and death and between physical pleasure and physical pain there be still a distinction but that be all
cut off from contact with the outer world and with the past the citizen of oceania be like a man in interstellar space who have no way of knowing which direction be up and which be down
the ruler of such a state be absolute as the pharaohs or the caesars could not be
he be oblige to prevent he follower from starve to death in number large enough to be inconvenient and he be oblige to remain at the same low level of military technique as he rival ; but once that minimum be achieve he can twist reality into whatever shape he choose
the war therefore if he judge he by the standard of previous war be merely an imposture
he be like the battle between certain ruminant animal who horn be set at such an angle that he be incapable of hurt one another
but though he be unreal he be not meaningless
he eats up the surplus of consumable goods and he help to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs
war he will be see be now a purely internal affair
in the past the ruling group of all country although he might recognize he common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war do fight against one another and the victor always plunder the vanquish
in he own day he be not fight against one another at all
the war be wage by each ruling group against he own subject and the object of the war be not to make or prevent conquest of territory but to keep the structure of society intact
the very word war therefore have become misleading
he would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war have cease to exist
the peculiar pressure that he exert on human being between the neolithic age and the early twentieth century have disappear and be replace by something quite different
the effect would be much the same if the three super-state instead of fight one another should agree to live in perpetual peace each inviolate within he own boundary
for in that case each would still be a self-contained universe free for ever from the sober influence of external danger
a peace that be truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war
this - although the vast majority of party member understand he only in a shallow sense - be the inner meaning of the party slogan : war be peace
winston stopped reading for a moment
somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thunder
the blissful feeling of be alone with the forbid book in a room with no telescreen have not wear off
solitude and safety be physical sensation mixed up somehow with the tiredness of he body the softness of the chair the touch of the faint breeze from the window that play upon he cheek
the book fascinate he or more exactly he reassure he
in a sense he tell he nothing that be new but that be part of the attraction
he say what he would have say if he have be possible for he to set he scatter thought in order
he be the product of a mind similar to he own but enormously more powerful more systematic less fear-ride
the good book he perceive be those that tell he what he know already
he have just turn back to chapter i when he hear julia have footstep on the stair and start out of he chair to meet he
he dump he brown tool-bag on the floor and fling himself into he arms
he be more than a week since he have see one another
i have get the book he say as he disentangle himself
oh he have get he ?
good he say without much interest and almost immediately kneel down beside the oilstove to make the coffee
he do not return to the subject until he have be in bed for half an hour
the evening be just cool enough to make he worth while to pull up the counterpane
from below came the familiar sound of sing and the scrape of boots on the flagstone
the brawny red-armed woman who winston have see there on he first visit be almost a fixture in the yard
there seem to be no hour of daylight when he be not march to and fro between the wash-tub and the line alternately gag himself with clothes peg and breaking forth into lusty song
julia have settle down on he side and seem to be already on the point of fall asleep
he reach out for the book which be lie on the floor and sit up against the bedhead
he musth read he he say
he too
all member of the brotherhood have to read he
he read he he say with he eyes shut
read he aloud
that have the good way
then he can explain he to he as he go
the clock have hands say six meaning eighteen
he have three or four hours ahead of them
he prop the book against he knee and begin reading :
chapter i
ignorance be strength
throughout record time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have be three kind of people in the world the high the middle and the low
he have be subdivide in many way he have bear countless different name and he relative number as well as he attitude towards one another have varied from age to age : but the essential structure of society have never alter
even after enormous upheaval and seemingly irrevocable change the same pattern have always reassert himself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far he be pushed one way or the other
julia be he awake ?
say winston
yes he love i be listen
go on
he have marvellous
he continue reading :
the aim of these three group be entirely irreconcilable
the aim of the high be to remain where he be
the aim of the middle be to change place with the high
the aim of the low when he have an aim - for he be an abiding characteristic of the low that he be too much crush by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside he daily live - be to abolish all distinction and create a society in which all man shall be equal
thus throughout history a struggle which be the same in he main outline recur over and over again
for long period the high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there always come a moment when he lose either he belief in himself or he capacity to govern efficiently or both
he be then overthrow by the middle who enlist the low on he side by pretend to them that he be fight for liberty and justice
as soon as he have reach he objective the middle thrust the low back into he old position of servitude and himself become the high
presently a new middle group splits off from one of the other group or from both of them and the struggle begin over again
of the three group only the low be never even temporarily successful in achieve he aim
he would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there have be no progress of a material kind
even today in a period of decline the average human be be physically good off than he be a few century ago
but no advance in wealth no soften of manners no reform or revolution have ever bring human equality a millimetre near
from the point of view of the low no historic change have ever mean much more than a change in the name of he master
by the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern have become obvious to many observer
there then rose school of thinker who interpret history as a cyclic process and claim to show that inequality be the unalterable law of human life
this doctrine of course have always have he adherent but in the manner in which he be now put forward there be a significant change
in the past the need for a hierarchical forme of society have be the doctrine specifically of the high
he have be preach by kingbolt and aristocrat and by the priest lawyer and the like who be parasitical upon them and he have generally be soften by promise of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave
the middle so long as he be struggle for power have always make use of such terms as freedom justice and fraternity
now however the concept of human brotherhood begin to be assail by people who be not yet in position of command but merely hope to be so before long
in the past the middle have make revolution under the banner of equality and then have establish a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one be overthrow
the new middle group in effect proclaim he tyranny beforehand
socialism a theory which appear in the early nineteenth century and be the last link in a chain of think stretch back to the slave rebellion of antiquity be still deeply infect by the utopianism of past age
but in each variant of socialism that appear from about 1900 onward the aim of establish liberty and equality be more and more openly abandoned
the new movement which appear in the middle year of the century ingsoc in oceania neo in eurasia death-worship as he be commonly call in eastasia have the conscious aim of perpetuate unfreedom and inequality
these new movement of course grow out of the old one and tend to keep he name and pay lip-service to he ideology
but the purpose of all of them be to arrest progress and freeze history at a choose moment
the familiar pendulum swing be to happen once more and then stop
as usual the high be to be turn out by the middle who would then become the high ; but this time by conscious strategy the high would be able to maintain he position permanently
the new doctrine arise partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge and the growth of the historical sense which have hardly exist before the nineteenth century
the cyclic movement of history be now intelligible or appear to be so ; and if he be intelligible then he be alterable
but the principal underlying cause be that as early as the beginning of the twentieth century human equality have become technically possible
he be still true that man be not equal in he native talent and that function have to be specialize in way that favour some individual against other ; but there be no longer any real need for class distinction or for large difference of wealth
in earlier age class distinction have be not only inevitable but desirable
inequality be the price of civilization
with the development of machine production however the case be alter
even if he be still necessary for human being to do different kind of work he be no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic level
therefore from the point of view of the new group who be on the point of seizing power human equality be no longer an ideal to be strive after but a danger to be avert
in more primitive age when a just and peaceful society be in fact not possible he have be fairly easy to believe he
the idea of an earthly paradise in which man should live together in a state of brotherhood without law and without brute labor have haunted the human imagination for thousand of year
and this vision have have a certain hold even on the group who actually profit by each historical change
the heir of the french english and american revolution have partly believe in he own phrase about the right of man freedom of speech equality before the law and the like and have even allow he conduct to be influenced by them to some extent
but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main current of political think be authoritarian
the earthly paradise have be discredit at exactly the moment when he become realizable
every new political theory by whatever name he call himself lead back to hierarchy and regimentation
and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930 practice which have be long abandoned in some case for hundred of year - imprisonment without trial the use of war prisoner as slave public execution torture to extract confession the use of hostage and the deportation of whole population - not only become common again but be tolerate and even defend by people who considered himself enlighten and progressive
he be only after a decade of national war civil war revolution and counter-revolution in all parts of the world that ingsoc and he rival emerge as fully worked-out political theory
but he have be foreshadow by the various system generally call totalitarian which have appear earlier in the century and the main outline of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos have long be obvious
what kind of people would control this world have be equally obvious
the new aristocracy be make up for the most part of bureaucrat scientist technician trade-union organizer publicity expert sociologist teacher journalist and professional politician
these people who origin lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grade of the working class have be shape and bring together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralize government
as compare with he opposite number in past age he be less avaricious less tempt by luxury hungry for pure power and above all more conscious of what he be doing and more intent on crush opposition
this last difference be cardinal
by comparison with that exist today all the tyranny of the past be half-hearted and inefficient
the ruling group be always infect to some extent by liberal idea and be content to leave loose end everywhere to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what he subject be thinking
even the catholic church of the middle age be tolerant by modern standard
part of the reason for this be that in the past no government have the power to keep he citizen under constant surveillance
the invention of print however make he easy to manipulate public opinion and the film and the radio carry the process further
with the development of television and the technical advance which make he possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument private life came to an end
every citizen or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watch could be keep for twentyfour hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda with all other channel of communication closed
the possibility of enforce not only complete obedience to the will of the state but complete uniformity of opinion on all subject now exist for the first time
after the revolutionary period of the fifty and sixty society regroup himself as always into high middle and low
but the new high group unlike all he forerunner do not act upon instinct but know what be need to safeguard he position
he have long be realize that the only secure basis for oligarchy be collectivism
wealth and privilege be most easily defend when he be possessed jointly
the so-called abolition of private property which take place in the middle year of the century mean in effect the concentration of property in far few hands than before : but with this difference that the new owner be a group instead of a mass of individual
individually no member of the party own anything except petty personal belongings
collectively the party own everything in oceania because he control everything and dispose of the product as he think fit
in the year following the revolution he be able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed because the whole process be re-present as an act of collectivization
he have always be assumed that if the capitalist class be expropriate socialism musth follow : and unquestionably the capitalist have be expropriate
factory mine land house transport - everything have be take away from them : and since these thing be no longer private property he follow that he musth be public property
ingsoc which grow out of the earlier socialist movement and inherited he phraseology have in fact carry out the main item in the socialist programme ; with the result foresee and intended beforehand that economic inequality have be make permanent
but the problem of perpetuate a hierarchical society go deep than this
there be only four way in which a ruling group can fall from power
either he be conquer from without or he govern so inefficiently that the masses be stir to revolt or he allow a strong and discontent middle group to come into be or he lose he own self-confidence and willingness to govern
these cause do not operate singly and as a rule all four of them be present in some degree
a ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently
ultimately the determine factor be the mental attitude of the ruling class himself
after the middle of the present century the first danger have in reality disappear
each of the three power which now divide the world be in fact unconquerable and could only become conquerable through slow demographic change which a government with wide power can easily avert
the second danger also be only a theoretical one
the masses never revolt of he own accord and he never revolt merely because he be oppress
indeed so long as he be not permit to have standard of comparison he never even become aware that he be oppress
the recurrent economic crisis of past time be totally unnecessary and be not now permit to happen but other and equally large dislocation can and do happen without have political result because there be no way in which discontent can become articulate
as for the problem of over-production which have be latent in he society since the development of machine technique he be solve by the device of continuous warfare ( see chapter iii ) which be also useful in key up public morale to the necessary pitch
from the point of view of he present ruler therefore the only genuine danger be the splitting-off of a new group of able underemployed power-hungry people and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in he own rank
the problem that be to say be educational
he be a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the direct group and of the large executive group that lie immediately below he
the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way
give this background one could infer if one do not know he already the general structure of oceanic society
at the apex of the pyramid come big brother
big brother be infallible and all-powerful
every success every achievement every victory every scientific discovery all knowledge all wisdom all happiness all virtue be hold to issue directly from he leadership and inspiration
nobody have ever see big brother
he be a face on the hoarding a voice on the telescreen
he may be reasonably sure that he will never die and there be already considerable uncertainty as to when he be born
big brother be the guise in which the party choose to exhibit himself to the world
he function be to act as a focus point for love fear and reverence emotion which be more easily feel towards an individual than towards an organization
below big brother come the inner party he number limited to six million or something less than 2 per cent of the population of oceania
below the inner party come the outer party which if the inner party be describe as the brain of the state may be justly liken to the hands
below that come the dumb masses who he habitually refer to as the prole number perhaps 85 per cent of the population
in the terms of he earlier classification the prole be the low : for the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror be not a permanent or necessary part of the structure
in principle membership of these three group be not hereditary
the child of inner party parent be in theory not born into the inner party
admission to either branch of the party be by examination take at the age of sixteen
nor be there any racial discrimination or any marked domination of one province by another
jews negroes south americans of pure indian blood be to be found in the high rank of the party and the administrator of any area be always drawn from the inhabitant of that area
in no part of oceania do the inhabitant have the feeling that he be a colonial population rule from a distant capital
oceania have no capital and he titular head be a person who whereabouts nobody know
except that english be he chief lingua franca and newspeak he official language he be not centralize in any way
he ruler be not hold together by blood-tie but by adherence to a common doctrine
he be true that he society be stratify and very rigidly stratify on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines
there be far less to-and-fro movement between the different group than happen under capitalism or even in the pre-industrial age
between the two branch of the party there be a certain amount of interchange but only so much as will ensure that weakling be exclude from the inner party and that ambitious member of the outer party be make harmless by allow them to rise
proletarian in practice be not allow to graduate into the party
the most gifted amongst them who might possibly become nucleus of discontent be simply marked down by the think police and eliminate
but this state of affairs be not necessarily permanent nor be he a matter of principle
the party be not a class in the old sense of the word
he do not aim at transmit power to he own child as such ; and if there be no other way of keeping the able people at the top he would be perfectly prepare to recruit an entire new generation from the rank of the proletariat
in the crucial year the fact that the party be not a hereditary body do a great deal to neutralize opposition
the old kind of socialist who have be train to fight against something call class privilege assumed that what be not hereditary can be permanent
he do not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical nor do he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracy have always be short-lived whereas adoptive organization such as the catholic church have sometimes last for hundred or thousand of year
the essence of oligarchic rule be not father-to-son inheritance but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life impose by the dead upon the living
a ruling group be a ruling group so long as he can nominate he successor
the party be not concerned with perpetuate he blood but with perpetuate himself
who wield power be not important provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same
all the belief habit taste emotion mental attitude that characterize he time be really design to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from be perceive
physical rebellion or any preliminary move towards rebellion be at present not possible
from the proletarian nothing be to be fear
left to himself he will continue from generation to generation and from century to century working breeding and dye not only without any impulse to rebel but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than he be
he could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique make he necessary to educate them more highly ; but since military and commercial rivalry be no longer important the level of popular education be actually decline
what opinion the masses hold or do not hold be look on as a matter of indifference
he can be grant intellectual liberty because he have no intellect
in a party member on the other hand not even the small deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerate
a party member live from birth to death under the eye of the think police
even when he be alone he can never be sure that he be alone
wherever he may be asleep or awake working or resting in he bath or in bed he can be inspect without warning and without knowing that he be be inspect
nothing that he do be indifferent
he friendship he relaxation he behaviour towards he wife and child the expression of he face when he be alone the word he mutter in sleep even the characteristic movement of he body be all jealously scrutinize
not only any actual misdemeanour but any eccentricity however small any change of habit any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle be certain to be detect
he have no freedom of choice in any direction whatever
on the other hand he action be not regulate by law or by any clearly formulate code of behaviour
in oceania there be no law
thought and action which when detect mean certain death be not formally forbid and the endless purge arrest torture imprisonment and vaporization be not inflict as punishment for crime which have actually be commit but be merely the wipe-out of person who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future
a party member be require to have not only the right opinion but the right instinct
many of the belief and attitude demand of he be never plainly stated and could not be stated without lay bare the contradiction inherent in ingsoc
if he be a person naturally orthodox ( in newspeak a goodthinker ) he will in all circumstance know without taking think what be the true belief or the desirable emotion
but in any case an elaborate mental training undergo in childhood and grouping himself round the newspeak word crimestop blackwhite and double-think make he unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever
a party member be expect to have no private emotion and no respite from enthusiasm
he be supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemy and internal traitor triumph over victory and self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the party
the discontent produce by he bare unsatisfying life be deliberately turn outward and dissipated by such device as the two minutes hate and the speculation which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude be kill in advance by he early acquire inner discipline
the first and simple stage in the discipline which can be teach even to young child be call in newspeak crimestop
crimestop means the faculty of stopping short as though by instinct at the threshold of any dangerous think
he include the power of not grasping analogy of failing to perceive logical error of misunderstanding the simple argument if he be inimical to ingsoc and of be bore or repel by any train of think which be capable of leading in a heretical direction
crimestop in short means protective stupidity
but stupidity be not enough
on the contrary orthodoxy in the full sense demand a control over one have own mental process as complete as that of a contortionist over he body
oceanic society rest ultimately on the belief that big brother be omnipotent and that the party be infallible
but since in reality big brother be not omnipotent and the party be not infallible there be need for an unwearying moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts
the keyword here be blackwhite
like so many newspeak word this word have two mutually contradictory meaning
applied to an opponent he means the habit of impudently claim that black be white in contradiction of the plain facts
applied to a party member he means a loyal willingness to say that black be white when party discipline demand this
but he means also the ability to believe that black be white and more to know that black be white and to forget that one have ever believe the contrary
this demand a continuous alteration of the past make possible by the system of think which really embrace all the rest and which be known in newspeak as double-think
the alteration of the past be necessary for two reason one of which be subsidiary and so to speak precautionary
the subsidiary reason be that the party member like the proletarian tolerate present-day condition partly because he have no standard of comparison
he musth be cut off from the past just as he musth be cut off from foreign country because he be necessary for he to believe that he be good off than he ancestor and that the average level of material comfort be constantly rising
but by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past be the need to safeguard the infallibility of the party
he be not merely that speech statistics and record of every kind musth be constantly bring up to date in order to show that the prediction of the party be in all case right
he be also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admit
for to change one have mind or even one have policy be a confession of weakness
if for example eurasia or eastasia ( whichever he may be ) be the enemy today then that country musth always have be the enemy
and if the facts say otherwise then the facts musth be alter
thus history be continuously rewrite
this day-to-day falsification of the past carry out by the ministry of truth be as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carry out by the ministry of love
the mutability of the past be the central tenet of ingsoc
past event he be argue have no objective existence but survive only in write record and in human memory
the past be whatever the record and the memory agree upon
and since the party be in full control of all record and in equally full control of the mind of he member he follow that the past be whatever the party choose to make he
he also follow that though the past be alterable he never have be alter in any specific instance
for when he have be re-create in whatever shape be need at the moment then this new version be the past and no different past can ever have exist
this hold good even when as often happen the same event have to be alter out of recognition several time in the course of a year
at all time the party be in possession of absolute truth and clearly the absolute can never have be different from what he be now
he will be see that the control of the past depend above all on the training of memory
to make sure that all write record agree with the orthodoxy of the moment be merely a mechanical act
but he be also necessary to remember that event happen in the desire manner
and if he be necessary to rearrange one have memory or to tamper with write record then he be necessary to forget that one have done so
the trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique
he be learned by the majority of party member and certainly by all who be intelligent as well as orthodox
in oldspeak he be call quite frankly reality control
in newspeak he be call double-think though double-think comprise much else as well
double-think means the power of holding two contradictory belief in one have mind simultaneously and accept both of them
the party intellectual know in which direction he memory musth be alter ; he therefore know that he be play trick with reality ; but by the exercise of double-think he also satisfy himself that reality be not violate
the process have to be conscious or he would not be carry out with sufficient precision but he also have to be unconscious or he would bring with he a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt
double-think lie at the very heart of ingsoc since the essential act of the party be to use conscious deception while retain the firmness of purpose that go with complete honesty
to tell deliberate lie while genuinely believe in them to forget any fact that have become inconvenient and then when he become necessary again to draw he back from oblivion for just so long as he be need to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one deny - all this be indispensably necessary
even in use the word double-think he be necessary to exercise double-think
for by use the word one admit that one be tamper with reality ; by a fresh act of double-think one erase this knowledge ; and so on indefinitely with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth
ultimately he be by means of double-think that the party have be able - and may for all he know continue to be able for thousand of year - to arrest the course of history
all past oligarchies have fall from power either because he ossify or because he grow soft
either he become stupid and arrogant fail to adjust himself to change circumstance and be overthrow ; or he become liberal and cowardly make concession when he should have used force and once again be overthrow
he fell that be to say either through consciousness or through unconsciousness
he be the achievement of the party to have produce a system of think in which both condition can exist simultaneously
and upon no other intellectual basis could the dominium of the party be make permanent
if one be to rule and to continue ruling one musth be able to dislocate the sense of reality
for the secret of rulership be to combine a belief in one have own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistake
he need hardly be say that the subtle practitioner of double-think be those who invent double-think and know that he be a vast system of mental cheat
in he society those who have the good knowledge of what be happening be also those who be farthest from seeing the world as he be
in general the great the understanding the great the delusion ; the more intelligent the less sane
one clear illustration of this be the fact that war hysteria increase in intensity as one rise in the social scale
those who attitude towards the war be most nearly rational be the subject people of the dispute territory
to these people the war be simply a continuous calamity which sweep to and fro over he body like a tidal wave
which side be winning be a matter of complete indifference to them
he be aware that a change of overlordship means simply that he will be doing the same work as before for new master who treat them in the same manner as the old one
the slightly more favour worker who he call the prole be only intermittently conscious of the war
when he be necessary he can be prod into frenzy of fear and hatred but when left to himself he be capable of forget for long period that the war be happening
he be in the rank of the party and above all of the inner party that the true war enthusiasm be found
world-conquest be believe in most firmly by those who know he to be impossible
this peculiar link-together of opposites - knowledge with ignorance cynicism with fanaticism - be one of the chief distinguish mark of oceanic society
the official ideology abound with contradiction even when there be no practical reason for them
thus the party reject and vilify every principle for which the socialist movement originally stand and he choose to do this in the name of socialism
he preach a contempt for the working class unexampled for century past and he diving he member in a uniform which be at one time peculiar to manual worker and be adopted for that reason
he systematically undermine the solidarity of the family and he call he leader by a name which be a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty
even the name of the four ministry by which he be govern exhibit a sort of impudence in he deliberate reversal of the facts
the ministry of peace concern himself with war the ministry of truth with lie the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation
these contradiction be not accidental nor do he result from ordinary hypocrisy ; he be deliberate exercise in double-think
for he be only by reconcile contradiction that power can be retain indefinitely
in no other way could the ancient cycle be break
if human equality be to be for ever avert - if the high as he have call them be to keep he place permanently - then the prevailing mental condition musth be control insanity
but there be one question which until this moment he have almost ignore
he be ; why should human equality be avert ?
suppose that the mechanics of the process have be rightly describe what be the motive for this huge accurately plan effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time ?
here he reach the central secret
as he have see the mystique of the party and above all of the inner party depend upon double-think
but deep than this lie the original motive the never-question instinct that first lead to the seizure of power and bring double-think the think police continuous warfare and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterward
this motive really consist .
winston become aware of silence as one become aware of a new sound
he seem to he that julia have be very still for some time past
he be lie on he side naked from the waist upward with he cheek pillow on he hand and one dark lock tumble across he eyes
he breast rose and fell slowly and regularly
julia
no answer
julia be he awake ?
no answer
he be asleep
he shut the book put he carefully on the floor lay down and pull the coverlet over both of them
he have still he reflect not learned the ultimate secret
he understand how ; he do not understand why
chapter i like chapter iii have not actually tell he anything that he do not know he have merely systematize the knowledge that he possessed already
but after reading he he know good than before that he be not mad
be in a minority even a minority of one do not make he mad
there be truth and there be untruth and if he cling to the truth even against the whole world he be not mad
a yellow beam from the sinking sun slant in through the window and fell across the pillow
he shut he eyes
the sun on he face and the girl have smooth body touching he own give he a strong sleepy confident feeling
he be safe everything be all right
he fell asleep murmur sanity be not statistical with the feeling that this remarque contain in he a profound wisdom
when he wake he be with the sensation of have sleep for a long time but a glance at the old-fashioned clock tell he that he be only twenty-thirty
he lay doze for a while ; then the usual deep-lunge sing strike up from the yard below :
he be only an 'opeless fancy
he pass like an ipril dye
but a look and a word and the dream he stir
he 'ave steal he 'eart awye !
the drivel song seem to have keep he popularity
he still hear he all over the place
he have outlive the hate song
julia wake at the sound stretch himself luxuriously and get out of bed
i be hungry he say
let have make some more coffee
damn !
the stove have go out and the water have cold
he pick the stove up and shake he
there have no oil in he
he can get some from old charrington i expect
the funny thing be i make sure he be full
i be going to put he clothes on he add
he seem to have get cold
winston also get up and dress himself
the indefatigable voice sing on :
he sye that time 'eals all thing
he sye he can always forget ;
but the smile and the tears acrorss the year
he twist he 'eart-string yet !
as he fasten the belt of he overall he stroll across to the window
the sun musth have go down behind the house ; he be not shine into the yard any longer
the flagstone be wet as though he have just be washed and he have the feeling that the sky have be washed too so fresh and pale be the blue between the chimney-pot
tirelessly the woman march to and fro corking and uncork himself sing and fall silent and peg out more diaper and more and yet more
he wonder whether he take in washing for a living or be merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchild
julia have come across to he side ; together he gaze down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below
as he look at the woman in he characteristic attitude he thick arms reach up for the line he powerful mare-like buttock protrude he strike he for the first time that he be beautiful
he have never before occur to he that the body of a woman of fifty blow up to monstrous dimension by child-bearing then hardened roughen by work till he be coarse in the grain like an over-ripe turnip could be beautiful
but he be so and after all he think why not ?
the solid contourless body like a block of granite and the rasping red skin bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose
why should the fruit be hold inferior to the flower ?
he have beautiful he murmur
he have a metre across the hip easily say julia
that be he style of beauty say winston
he hold julia have supple waist easily encircle by he arm
from the hip to the knee he flank be against he
out of he body no child would ever come
that be the one thing he could never do
only by word of mouth from mind to mind could he pass on the secret
the woman down there have no mind he have only strong arms a warm heart and a fertile belly
he wonder how many child he have give birth to
he might easily be fifteen
he have have he momentary flowering a year perhaps of wild-rose beauty and then he have suddenly swell like a fertilize fruit and grown hard and red and coarse and then he life have be launder scrub darning cook sweeping polish mending scrub launder first for child then for grandchild over thirty unbroken year
at the end of he he be still sing
the mystical reverence that he feel for he be somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale cloudless sky stretch away behind the chimney-pot into interminable distance
he be curious to think that the sky be the same for everybody in eurasia or eastasia as well as here
and the people under the sky be also very much the same - everywhere all over the world hundred of thousand of million of people just like this people ignorant of one another have existence hold apart by wall of hatred and lie and yet almost exactly the same - people who have never learned to think but who be store up in he hearts and belly and muscle the power that would one day overturn the world
if there be hope he lay in the prole !
without have read to the end of the book he know that that musth be goldstein have final message
the future belong to the prole
and could he be sure that when he time came the world he construct would not be just as alien to he winston smith as the world of the party ?
yes because at the least he would be a world of sanity
where there be equality there can be sanity
sooner or later he would happen strength would change into consciousness
the prole be immortal he could not doubt he when he look at that valiant figure in the yard
in the end he awakening would come
and until that happen though he might be a thousand year he would stay alive against all the odds like bird passing on from body to body the vitality which the party do not share and could not kill
do he remember he say the thrush that sing to he that first day at the edge of the wood ?
he wasn't sing to he say julia
he be sing to please himself
not even that
he be just sing
the bird sing the prole sing the party do not sing
all round the world in london and new york in africa and brazil and in the mysterious forbid lands beyond the frontier in the street of paris and berlin in the village of the endless russian plain in the bazaar of china and japan - everywhere stand the same solid unconquerable figure make monstrous by work and child-bearing toil from birth to death and still sing
out of those mighty loins a race of conscious being musth one day come
he be the dead he be the future
but he could share in that future if he keep alive the mind as he keep alive the body and pass on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four
he be the dead he say
he be the dead echoed julia dutifully
he be the dead say an iron voice behind them
he spring apart
winston have entrails seem to have turn into ice
he could see the white all round the iris of julia have eyes
he face have turn a milky yellow
the smear of rouge that be still on each cheekbone stand out sharply almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath
he be the dead repeated the iron voice
he be behind the picture breathed julia
he be behind the picture say the voice
remain exactly where he be
make no movement until he be order
he be start he be start at last !
he could do nothing except stand gaze into one another have eyes
to run for life to get out of the house before he be too late - no such think occur to them
unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall
there be a snap as though a catch have be turn back and a crash of breaking glass
the picture have fall to the floor uncover the telescreen behind he
now he can see he say julia
now he can see he say the voice
stand out in the middle of the room
stand back to back
clasp he hands behind he heads
do not touch one another
he be not touching but he seem to he that he could feel julia have body shake
or perhaps he be merely the shake of he own
he could just stop he tooth from chatter but he knee be beyond he control
there be a sound of trample boots below inside the house and outside
the yard seem to be full of man
something be be drag across the stone
the woman have sing have stopped abruptly
there be a long rolling clang as though the wash-tub have be fling across the yard and then a confusion of angry shout which end in a yell of pain
the house be surround say winston
the house be surround say the voice
he hear julia snap he tooth together
i suppose he may as well say good-bye he say
he may as well say good-bye say the voice
and then another quite different voice a thin cultivated voice which winston have the impression of have hear before strike in ; and by the way while he be on the subject here come a candle to light he to bed here come a chopper to chop off he head !
something crash on to the bed behind winston have back
the head of a ladder have be thrust through the window and have burst in the frame
someone be climbing through the window
there be a stampede of boots up the stairs
the room be full of solid man in black uniform with iron-shoe boots on he foot and truncheon in he hands
winston be not tremble any longer
even he eyes he barely move
one thing alone matter ; to keep still to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit he !
a man with a smooth prizefighter have jowl in which the mouth be only a slit pause opposite he balance he truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger
winston meet he eyes
the feeling of nakedness with one have hands behind one have head and one have face and body all exposed be almost unbearable
the man protrude the tip of a white tongue lick the place where he lip should have be and then pass on
there be another crash
someone have pick up the glass paper-weight from the table and smashed he to piece on the hearth-stone
the fragment of coral a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake roll across the mat
how small think winston how small he always be !
there be a gasp and a thump behind he and he receive a violent kick on the ankle which nearly fling he off he balance
one of the man have smashed he fist into julia have solar plexus double he up like a pocket ruler
he be thrashing about on the floor fight for breath
winston dare not turn he head even by a millimetre but sometimes he livid gasp face came within the angle of he vision
even in he terror he be as though he could feel the pain in he own body the deadly pain which nevertheless be less urgent than the struggle to get back he breath
he know what he be like ; the terrible agonize pain which be there all the while but could not be suffer yet because before all else he be necessary to be able to breathe
then two of the man hoist he up by knee and shoulder and carry he out of the room like a sack
winston have a glimpse of he face upside down yellow and contorted with the eyes shut and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek ; and that be the last he saw of he
he stand dead still
no one have hit he yet
thought which came of he own accord but seem totally uninteresting begin to flit through he mind
he wonder whether he have get mr charrington
he wonder what he have done to the woman in the yard
he notice that he badly want to urinate and feel a faint surprise because he have done so only two or three hours ago
he notice that the clock on the mantelpiece say nine meaning twenty-one
but the light seem too strong
would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an august evening ?
he wonder whether after all he and julia have mistake the time - have sleep the clock round and think he be twenty-thirty when really he be nought eight-thirty on the following morning
but he do not pursue the think further
he be not interesting
there be another lighter step in the passage
mr charrington came into the room
the demeanour of the black-uniform man suddenly become more subdued
something have also change in mr charrington have appearance
he eye fell on the fragment of the glass paper-weight
pick up those piece he say sharply
a man stoop to obey
the cockney accent have disappear ; winston suddenly realize who voice he be that he have hear a few moment ago on the telescreen
mr charrington be still wearing he old velvet jacket but he hair which have be almost white have turn black
also he be not wearing he spectacles
he give winston a single sharp glance as though verify he identity and then pay no more attention to he
he be still recognizable but he be not the same person any longer
he body have straighten and seem to have grown big
he face have undergo only tiny change that have nevertheless worked a complete transformation
the black eyebrow be less bushy the wrinkle be go the whole lines of the face seem to have alter ; even the nose seem short
he be the alert cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty
he occur to winston that for the first time in he life he be look with knowledge at a member of the think police
he do not know where he be
presumably he be in the ministry of love but there be no way of making certain
he be in a high windowless cell with wall of glitter white porcelain
conceal lamp flood he with cold light and there be a low steady hum sound which he supposed have something to do with the air supply
a bench or shelf just wide enough to sit on run round the wall break only by the door and at the end opposite the door a lavatory pan with no wooden seat
there be four telescreens one in each wall
there be a dull ache in he belly
he have be there ever since he have bundle he into the closed van and drive he away
but he be also hungry with a gnawing unwholesome kind of hunger
he might be twenty-four hours since he have eat he might be thirty-six
he still do not know probably never would know whether he have be morning or evening when he arrest he
since he be arrest he have not be feed
he sit as still as he could on the narrow bench with he hands cross on he knee
he have already learned to sit still
if he make unexpected movement he yell at he from the telescreen
but the crave for food be grow upon he
what he long for above all be a piece of bread
he have an idea that there be a few breadcrumb in the pocket of he overall
he be even possible - he think this because from time to time something seem to tickle he leg - that there might be a sizable bit of crust there
in the end the temptation to find out overcome he fear ; he slip a hand into he pocket
smith ! yell a voice from the telescreen 6079 smith w !
hands out of pocket in the cell !
he sit still again he hands cross on he knee
before be bring here he have be take to another place which musth have be an ordinary prison or a temporary lock used by the patrol
he do not know how long he have be there ; some hours at any rate ; with no clock and no daylight he be hard to gauge the time
he be a noisy evil-smell place
he have put he into a cell similar to the one he be now in but filthily dirty and at all time crowded by ten or fifteen people
the majority of them be common criminal but there be a few political prisoner amongst them
he have sit silent against the wall jostle by dirty body too preoccupied by fear and the pain in he belly to take much interest in he surroundings but still notice the astonishing difference in demeanour between the party prisoner and the other
the party prisoner be always silent and terrify but the ordinary criminal seem to care nothing for anybody
he yell insult at the guard fight back fiercely when he belongings be impound write obscene word on the floor eat smuggle food which he produce from mysterious hiding-place in he clothes and even shout down the telescreen when he try to restore order
on the other hand some of them seem to be on good terms with the guard call them by nickname and try to wheedle cigarette through the spyhole in the door
the guard too treat the common criminal with a certain forbearance even when he have to handle them roughly
there be much talk about the forced-labor camp to which most of the prisoner expect to be send
he be all right in the camp he gather so long as he have good contact and know the rope
there be bribery favouritism and racketeering of every kind there be homosexuality and prostitution there be even illicit alcohol distil from potato
the position of trust be give only to the common criminal especially the gangster and the murderer who form a sort of aristocracy
all the dirty job be done by the politicals
there be a constant come-and-go of prisoner of every description : drug-peddler thieve bandit black drunk prostitute
some of the drunk be so violent that the other prisoner have to combine to suppress them
an enormous wreck of a woman aged about sixty with great tumble breast and thick coil of white hair which have come down in he struggle be carry in kick and shout by four guard who have hold of he one at each corner
he wrench off the boots with which he have be trying to kick them and dump he down across winston have lap almost breaking he thigh-bone
the woman hoist himself upright and follow them out with a yell of f - bastard !
then notice that he be sitting on something uneven he slide off winston have knee on to the bench
beg pardon deary he say
i would 'a sit on he only the bugger put he there
he dono 'ow to treat a lady do he ?
he pause pat he breast and belch
pardon he say i be meself quite
he lean forward and vomit copiously on the floor
thass good he say leaning back with closed eyes
never keep he down thass what i say
get he up while he have fresh on he stomach like
he revive turn to have another look at winston and seem immediately to take a fancy to he
he put a vast arm round he shoulder and draw he towards he breathing beer and vomit into he face
wass he name deary ?
he say
smith say winston
smith ?
say the woman
thass funny
he name have smith too
why he add sentimentally i might be he mother !
he might think winston be he mother
he be about the right age and physique and he be probable that people change somewhat after twenty year in a forced-labor camp
no one else have speak to he
to a surprising extent the ordinary criminal ignore the party prisoner
the polits he call them with a sort of uninterested contempt
the party prisoner seem terrify of speaking to anybody and above all of speaking to one another
only once when two party member both woman be press close together on the bench he overhear amidst the din of voice a few hurriedly-whisper word ; and in particular a reference to something call room one-oh-one which he do not understand
he might be two or three hours ago that he have bring he here
the dull pain in he belly never go away but sometimes he grow good and sometimes bad and he thought expanded or contract accordingly
when he grow bad he think only of the pain himself and of he desire for food
when he grow good panic take hold of he
there be moment when he foresee the thing that would happen to he with such actuality that he heart gallop and he breath stopped
he feel the smash of truncheon on he elbow and iron-shoe boots on he shin ; he saw himself grovel on the floor scream for mercy through break tooth
he hardly think of julia
he could not fix he mind on he
he love he and would not betray he ; but that be only a fact known as he know the rule of arithmetic
he feel no love for he and he hardly even wonder what be happening to he
he think often of o'brien with a flicker hope
o'brien might know that he have be arrest
the brotherhood he have say never try to save he member
but there be the razor blade ; he would scend the razor blade if he could
there would be perhaps five second before the guard could rush into the cell
the blade would bite into he with a sort of burning coldness and even the finger that hold he would be cut to the bone
everything came back to he sick body which shrink tremble from the small pain
he be not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he get the chance
he be more natural to exist from moment to moment accept another ten minutes ' life even with the certainty that there be torture at the end of he
sometimes he try to calculate the number of porcelain brick in the wall of the cell
he should have be easy but he always lose count at some point or another
more often he wonder where he be and what time of day he be
at one moment he feel certain that he be broad daylight outside and at the next equally certain that he be pitch darkness
in this place he know instinctively the lights would never be turn out
he be the place with no darkness : he saw now why o'brien have seem to recognize the allusion
in the ministry of love there be no window
he cell might be at the heart of the building or against he outer wall ; he might be ten floor below ground or thirty above he
he move himself mentally from place to place and try to determine by the feeling of he body whether he be perch high in the air or bury deep underground
there be a sound of march boots outside
the steel door open with a clang
a young officer a trim black-uniform figure who seem to glitter all over with polished leather and who pale straight-feature face be like a wax masque step smartly through the doorway
he motion to the guard outside to bring in the prisoner he be leading
the poet ampleforth shamble into the cell
the door clang shut again
ampleforth make one or two uncertain movement from side to side as though have some idea that there be another door to go out of and then begin to wander up and down the cell
he have not yet notice winston have presence
he trouble eyes be gaze at the wall about a metre above the level of winston have head
he be shoeless ; large dirty toe be stick out of the hole in he sock
he be also several days away from a shave
a scrubby beard cover he face to the cheekbone give he an air of ruffianism that go oddly with he large weak frame and nervous movement
winston rouse himself a little from he lethargy
he musth speak to ampleforth and risk the yell from the telescreen
he be even conceivable that ampleforth be the bearer of the razor blade
ampleforth he say
there be no yell from the telescreen
ampleforth pause mildly startle
he eyes focus himself slowly on winston
ah smith ! he say
he too !
what be he in for ?
to tell he the truth - he sit down awkwardly on the bench opposite winston
there be only one offence be there not ?
he say
and have he commit he ?
apparently i have
he put a hand to he forehead and press he temple for a moment as though trying to remember something
these thing happen he begin vaguely
i have be able to recall one instance - a possible instance
he be an indiscretion undoubtedly
he be produce a definitive edition of the poem of kipling
i allow the word god to remain at the end of a line
i could not help he ! he add almost indignantly raising he face to look at winston
he be impossible to change the line
the rhyme be ranging
do he realize that there be only twelve rhyme to ranging in the entire language ?
for days i have rack he brain
there be no other rhyme
the expression on he face change
the annoyance pass out of he and for a moment he look almost please
a sort of intellectual warmth the joy of the pedant who have found out some useless fact shine through the dirt and scrubby hair
have he ever occur to he he say that the whole history of english poetry have be determined by the fact that the english language lack rhyme ?
no that particular think have never occur to winston
nor in the circumstance do he strike he as very important or interesting
do he know what time of day he be ?
he say
ampleforth look startle again
i have hardly think about he
he arrest he - he could be two days ago - perhaps three
he eyes flit round the wall as though he half expect to find a window somewhere
there be no difference between night and day in this place
i do not see how one can calculate the time
he talk desultorily for some minutes then without apparent reason a yell from the telescreen bid them be silent
winston sit quietly he hands cross
ampleforth too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench fidget from side to side clasp he lank hands first round one knee then round the other
the telescreen bark at he to keep still
time pass
twenty minutes an hour - he be difficult to judge
once more there be a sound of boots outside
winston have entrails contract
soon very soon perhaps in five minutes perhaps now the tramp of boots would mean that he own turn have come
the door open
the cold-face young officer step into the cell
with a brief movement of the hand he indicate ampleforth
room 101 he say
ampleforth march clumsily out between the guard he face vaguely perturb but uncomprehending
what seem like a long time pass
the pain in winston have belly have revive
he mind sag round and round on the same trick like a ball fall again and again into the same series of slot
he have only six thought
the pain in he belly ; a piece of bread ; the blood and the scream ; o'brien ; julia ; the razor blade
there be another spasm in he entrails the heavy boots be approach
as the door open the wave of air that he create bring in a powerful smell of cold sweat
parson walk into the cell
he be wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt
this time winston be startle into self-forgetfulness
he here ! he say
parson give winston a glance in which there be neither interest nor surprise but only misery
he begin walking jerkily up and down evidently unable to keep still
each time he straighten he pudgy knee he be apparent that he be tremble
he eyes have a wide-open stare look as though he could not prevent himself from gaze at something in the middle distance
what be he in for ?
say winston
thoughtcrime ! say parson almost blubber
the tone of he voice implied at once a complete admission of he guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be applied to himself
he pause opposite winston and begin eagerly appeal to he : he do think he will shoot he do he old chap ?
he do shoot he if he have actually done anything - only thought which he can help ?
i know he give he a fair hearing
oh i trust them for that !
he will know he record will he ?
he know what kind of chap i be
not a bad chap in he way
not brainy of course but keen
i try to do he good for the party do i ?
i will get off with five year do he think ?
or even ten year ?
a chap like he could make himself pretty useful in a labor-camp
he would shoot he for going off the rail just once ?
be he guilty ?
say winston
of course i be guilty ! cry parson with a servile glance at the telescreen
he do think the party would arrest an innocent man do he ?
he frog-like face grow calm and even take on a slightly sanctimonious expression
thoughtcrime be a dreadful thing old man he say sententiously
he have insidious
he can get hold of he without he even knowing he
do he know how he get hold of he ?
in he sleep !
yes that have a fact
there i be working away trying to do he bit - never know i have any bad stuff in he mind at all
and then i start talk in he sleep
do he know what he hear he saying ?
he sink he voice like someone who be oblige for medical reason to utter an obscenity
down with big brother !
yes i say that !
say he over and over again he seem
between he and he old man i be glad he get he before he go any further
do he know what i be going to say to them when i go up before the tribunal ?
thank he i be going to say thank he for saving he before he be too late
who denounce he ?
say winston
he be he little daughter say parson with a sort of doleful pride
he listen at the keyhole
hear what i be saying and nipped off to the patrol the very next day
pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh ?
i do bear he any grudge for he
in fact i be proud of he
he show i bring he up in the right spirit anyway
he make a few more jerky movement up and down several time casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan
then he suddenly rip down he shorts
excuse he old man he say
i can help he
he have the wait
he plump he large posterior into the lavatory pan
winston cover he face with he hands
smith ! yell the voice from the telescreen 6079 smith w !
uncover he face
no face cover in the cell
winston uncovered he face
parson used the lavatory loudly and abundantly
he then turn out that the plug be defective and the cell stink abominably for hours afterward
parson be removed
more prisoner came and go mysteriously
one a woman be consign to room 101 and winston notice seem to shrivel and turn a different colour when he hear the word
a time came when if he have be morning when he be bring here he would be afternoon ; or if he have be afternoon then he would be midnight
there be six prisoner in the cell man and woman
all sit very still
opposite winston there sit a man with a chinless toothy face exactly like that of some large harmless rodent
he fat mottle cheek be so pouched at the bottom that he be difficult not to believe that he have little stores of food tuck away there
he pale-grey eyes flit timorously from face to face and turn quickly away again when he catch anyone have eye
the door open and another prisoner be bring in who appearance send a momentary chill through winston
he be a commonplace mean-look man who might have be an engineer or technician of some kind
but what be startling be the emaciation of he face
he be like a skull
because of he thinness the mouth and eyes look disproportionately large and the eyes seem fill with a murderous unappeasable hatred of somebody or something
the man sit down on the bench at a little distance from winston
winston do not look at he again but the torment skull-like face be as vivid in he mind as though he have be straight in front of he eyes
suddenly he realize what be the matter
the man be dye of starvation
the same think seem to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell
there be a very faint stirring all the way round the bench
the eyes of the chinless man keep flit towards the skull-face man then turning guiltily away then be drag back by an irresistible attraction
presently he begin to fidget on he seat
at last he stand up waddle clumsily across the cell dig down into the pocket of he overall and with an abash air hold out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-face man
there be a furious deafen roar from the telescreen
the chinless man jump in he tracks
the skull-face man have quickly thrust he hands behind he back as though demonstrate to all the world that he refuse the gift
bumstead ! roar the voice 2713 bumstead j !
let fall that piece of bread !
the chinless man drop the piece of bread on the floor
remain standing where he be say the voice
face the door
make no movement
the chinless man obey
he large pouchy cheek be quiver uncontrollably
the door clang open
as the young officer enter and step aside there emerge from behind he a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and shoulder
he take he stand opposite the chinless man and then at a signal from the officer let free a frightful blow with all the weight of he body behind he full in the chinless man have mouth
the force of he seem almost to knock he clear of the floor
he body be fling across the cell and fetch up against the base of the lavatory seat
for a moment he lay as though stun with dark blood ooze from he mouth and nose
a very faint whimpering or squeak which seem unconscious came out of he
then he roll over and raise himself unsteadily on hands and knee
amidst a stream of blood and saliva the two halve of a dental plate fell out of he mouth
the prisoner sit very still he hands cross on he knee
the chinless man climb back into he place
down one side of he face the flesh be darken
he mouth have swell into a shapeless cherry-colored mass with a black hole in the middle of he
from time to time a little blood drip on to the breast of he overall
he grey eyes still flit from face to face more guiltily than ever as though he be trying to discover how much the other despise he for he humiliation
the door open
with a small gesture the officer indicate the skull-face man
room 101 he say
there be a gasp and a flurry at winston have side
the man have actually fling himself on he knee on the floor with he hand clasp together
comrade !
officer ! he cry
he do have to take he to that place !
have i tell he everything already ?
what else be he he want to know ?
there have nothing i would confess nothing !
just tell he what he be and i will confess straight off
write he down and i will sign he - anything !
not room 101 !
room 101 say the officer
the man have face already very pale turn a colour winston would not have believe possible
he be definitely unmistakably a shade of green
do anything to he ! he yell
he have be starve he for week
finish he off and let he die
shoot he
hang he
sentence he to twenty-five year
be there somebody else he want he to give away ?
just say who he be and i will tell he anything he want
i do care who he be or what he do to them
i have get a wife and three child
the big of them be six year old
he can take the whole lot of them and cut he throat in front of he eyes and i will stand by and watch he
but not room 101 !
room 101 say the officer
the man look frantically round at the other prisoner as though with some idea that he could put another victim in he own place
he eyes settle on the smashed face of the chinless man
he fling out a lean arm
that have the one he aught to be taking not he ! he shout
he do hear what he be saying after he bash he face
give he a chance and i will tell he every word of he
he have the one that have against the party not he
the guard step forward
the man have voice rose to a shriek
he do hear he ! he repeated
something go wrong with the telescreen
he have the one he want
take he not he !
the two sturdy guard have stoop to take he by the arms
but just at this moment he fling himself across the floor of the cell and grab one of the iron leg that support the bench
he have set up a wordless howl like an animal
the guard take hold of he to wrench he loose but he cling on with astonishing strength
for perhaps twenty second he be haul at he
the prisoner sit quiet he hands cross on he knee look straight in front of them
the howl stopped ; the man have no breath left for anything except hanging on
then there be a different kind of cry
a kick from a guard have boot have break the finger of one of he hands
he drag he to he foot
room 101 say the officer
the man be lead out walking unsteadily with head sink nurse he crush hand all the fight have go out of he
a long time pass
if he have be midnight when the skull-face man be take away he be morning : if morning he be afternoon
winston be alone and have be alone for hours
the pain of sitting on the narrow bench be such that often he get up and walk about unreproved by the telescreen
the piece of bread still lay where the chinless man have drop he
at the beginning he need a hard effort not to look at he but presently hunger give way to thirst
he mouth be sticky and evil-taste
the hum sound and the unvarying white light induce a sort of faintness an empty feeling inside he head
he would get up because the ache in he bone be no longer bearable and then would sit down again almost at once because he be too dizzy to make sure of stay on he foot
whenever he physical sensation be a little under control the terror return
sometimes with a fading hope he think of o'brien and the razor blade
he be thinkable that the razor blade might arrive conceal in he food if he be ever feed
more dimly he think of julia
somewhere or other he be suffering perhaps far bad than he
he might be scream with pain at this moment
he think : if i could save julia by double he own pain would i do he ?
yes i would
but that be merely an intellectual decision take because he know that he aught to take he
he do not feel he
in this place he could not feel anything except pain and foreknowledge of pain
besides be he possible when he be actually suffering he to wish for any reason that he own pain should increase ?
but that question be not answerable yet
the boots be approach again
the door open
o'brien came in
winston start to he foot
the shock of the sight have drive all caution out of he
for the first time in many year he forget the presence of the telescreen
he have get he too ! he cry
he get he a long time ago say o'brien with a mild almost regretful irony
he step aside
from behind he there emerge a broad-chested guard with a long black truncheon in he hand
he know he winston say o'brien
do deceive himself
he do know he - he have always known he
yes he saw now he have always known he
but there be no time to think of that
all he have eyes for be the truncheon in the guard have hand
he might fall anywhere ; on the crown on the tip of the ear on the upper arm on the elbow -
the elbow !
he have slump to he knee almost paralyse clasp the strike elbow with he other hand
everything have explode into yellow light
inconceivable inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain !
the light clear and he could see the other two look down at he
the guard be laugh at he contortion
one question at any rate be answer
never for any reason on earth could he wish for an increase of pain
of pain he could wish only one thing : that he should stop
nothing in the world be so bad as physical pain
in the face of pain there be no hero no hero he think over and over as he writhe on the floor clutch uselessly at he disable left arm
he be lie on something that feel like a camp bed except that he be high off the ground and that he be fixed down in some way so that he could not move
light that seem strong than usual be fall on he face
o'brien be standing at he side look down at he intently
at the other side of he stand a man in a white coat holding a hypodermic syringe
even after he eyes be open he take in he surroundings only gradually
he have the impression of swim up into this room from some quite different world a sort of underwater world far beneath he
how long he have be down there he do not know
since the moment when he arrest he he have not see darkness or daylight
besides he memory be not continuous
there have be time when consciousness even the sort of consciousness that one have in sleep have stopped dead and start again after a blank interval
but whether the interval be of days or week or only second there be no way of knowing
with that first blow on the elbow the nightmare have start
later he be to realize that all that then happen be merely a preliminary a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoner be subject
there be a long range of crime - espionage sabotage and the like - to which everyone have to confess as a matter of course
the confession be a formality though the torture be real
how many time he have be beat how long the beating have continue he could not remember
always there be five or six man in black uniform at he simultaneously
sometimes he be fist sometimes he be truncheon sometimes he be steel ranging sometimes he be boots
there be time when he roll about the floor as shameless as an animal writhe he body this way and that in an endless hopeless effort to dodge the kick and simply inviting more and yet more kick in he rib in he belly on he elbow on he shin in he groin in he testicle on the bone at the base of he spine
there be time when he go on and on until the cruel wicked unforgivable thing seem to he not that the guard continue to beat he but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness
there be time when he nerve so forsake he that he begin shout for mercy even before the beating begin when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow be enough to make he pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crime
there be other time when he start out with the resolve of confess nothing when every word have to be forced out of he between gasp of pain and there be time when he feebly try to compromise when he say to himself : i will confess but not yet
i musth hold out till the pain become unbearable
three more kick two more kick and then i will tell them what he want
sometimes he be beat till he could hardly stand then fling like a sack of potato on to the stone floor of a cell left to recuperate for a few hours and then take out and beat again
there be also longer period of recovery
he remember them dimly because he be spend chiefly in sleep or stupor
he remember a cell with a plank bed a sort of shelf stick out from the wall and a tin wash-basin and meal of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee
he remember a surly barber arrive to scrape he chin and crop he hair and business-like unsympathetic man in white coat feeling he pulse tap he reflex turning up he eyelid running harsh finger over he in search for break bone and shoot needle into he arm to make he sleep
the beating grow less frequent and become mainly a threat a horror to which he could be send back at any moment when he answer be unsatisfactory
he questioner now be not ruffian in black uniform but party intellectual little rotund man with quick movement and flashing spectacles who worked on he in relay over period which last - he think he could not be sure - ten or twelve hours at a stretch
these other questioner saw to he that he be in constant slight pain but he be not chiefly pain that he rely on
he slap he face wring he ear pull he hair make he stand on one leg refuse he leave to urinate shine glaring lights in he face until he eyes run with water ; but the aim of this be simply to humiliate he and destroy he power of argue and reasoning
he real weapon be the merciless questioning that go on and on hour after hour trip he up lay traps for he twist everything that he say convict he at every step of lie and self-contradiction until he begin weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue sometimes he would weep half a dozen time in a single session
most of the time he scream abuse at he and threaten at every hesitation to deliver he over to the guard again ; but sometimes he would suddenly change he tune call he comrade appeal to he in the name of ingsoc and big brother and ask he sorrowfully whether even now he have not enough loyalty to the party left to make he wish to undo the evil he have done
when he nerves be in rags after hours of questioning even this appeal could reduce he to snivel tears
in the end the nag voice break he down more completely than the boots and fist of the guard
he become simply a mouth that utter a hand that sign whatever be demand of he
he sole concern be to find out what he want he to confess and then confess he quickly before the bully start anew
he confess to the assassination of eminent party member the distribution of seditious pamphlet embezzlement of public funds sale of military secret sabotage of every kind
he confess that he have be a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as 1968
he confess that he be a religious believer an admirer of capitalism and a sexual pervert
he confess that he have murder he wife although he know and he questioner musth have known that he wife be still alive
he confess that for year he have be in personal touch with goldstein and have be a member of an underground organization which have included almost every human be he have ever known
he be easy to confess everything and implicate everybody
besides in a sense he be all true
he be true that he have be the enemy of the party and in the eyes of the party there be no distinction between the think and the deed
there be also memory of another kind
he stand out in he mind disconnectedly like picture with blackness all round them
he be in a cell which might have be either dark or light because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes
near at hand some kind of instrument be ticking slowly and regularly
the eyes grow large and more luminous
suddenly he float out of he seat dive into the eyes and be swallow up
he be strapped into a chair surround by dial under dazzle lights
a man in a white coat be reading the dial
there be a tramp of heavy boots outside
the door clang open
the wax-face officer march in follow by two guard
room 101 say the officer
the man in the white coat do not turn round
he do not look at winston either ; he be look only at the dial
he be rolling down a mighty corridor a kilometre wide full of glorious golden light roaring with laughter and shout out confession at the top of he voice
he be confess everything even the thing he have succeed in holding back under the torture
he be relate the entire history of he life to an audience who know he already
with he be the guard the other questioner the man in white coat o'brien julia mr charrington all rolling down the corridor together and shout with laughter
some dreadful thing which have lie embed in the future have somehow be skip over and have not happen
everything be all right there be no more pain the last detail of he life be lay bare understand forgive
he be start up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he have hear o'brien have voice
all through he interrogation although he have never see he he have have the feeling that o'brien be at he elbow just out of sight
he be o'brien who be direct everything
he be he who set the guard on to winston and who prevent them from killing he
he be he who decided when winston should scream with pain when he should have a respite when he should be feed when he should sleep when the drug should be pump into he arm
he be he who ask the question and suggest the answer
he be the tormentor he be the protector he be the inquisitor he be the friend
and once - winston could not remember whether he be in drug sleep or in normal sleep or even in a moment of wakefulness - a voice murmur in he ear : do worry winston ; he be in he keeping
for seven year i have watch over he
now the turning-point have come
i shall save he i shall make he perfect
he be not sure whether he be o'brien have voice ; but he be the same voice that have say to he he shall meet in the place where there be no darkness in that other dream seven year ago
he do not remember any ending to he interrogation
there be a period of blackness and then the cell or room in which he now be have gradually materialize round he
he be almost flat on he back and unable to move
he body be hold down at every essential point
even the back of he head be grip in some manner
o'brien be look down at he gravely and rather sadly
he face see from below look coarse and wear with pouch under the eyes and tire lines from nose to chin
he be old than winston have think he ; he be perhaps forty-eight or fifty
under he hand there be a dial with a lever on top and figure running round the face
i tell he say o'brien that if he meet again he would be here
yes say winston
without any warning except a slight movement of o'brien have hand a wave of pain flood he body
he be a frighten pain because he could not see what be happening and he have the feeling that some mortal injury be be done to he
he do not know whether the thing be really happening or whether the effect be electrically produce ; but he body be be wrench out of shape the joint be be slowly tear apart
although the pain have bring the sweat out on he forehead the bad of all be the fear that he backbone be about to snap
he set he tooth and breathed hard through he nose trying to keep silent as long as possible
he be afraid say o'brien watch he face that in another moment something be going to break
he especial fear be that he will be he backbone
he have a vivid mental picture of the vertebra snap apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them
that be what he be thinking be he not winston ?
winston do not answer
o'brien draw back the lever on the dial
the wave of pain re-cede almost as quickly as he have come
that be forty say o'brien
he can see that the number on this dial run up to a hundred
will he please remember throughout he conversation that i have he in he power to inflict pain on he at any moment and to whatever degree i choose ?
if he tell he any lie or attempt to prevaricate in any way or even fall below he usual level of intelligence he will cry out with pain instantly
do he understand that ?
yes say winston
o'brien have manner become less severe
he resettle he spectacles thoughtfully and take a pace or two up and down
when he spoke he voice be gentle and patient
he have the air of a doctor a teacher even a priest anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish
i be taking trouble with he winston he say because he be worth trouble
he know perfectly well what be the matter with he
he have known he for year though he have fight against the knowledge
he be mentally derange
he suffer from a defective memory
he be unable to remember real event and he persuade himself that he remember other event which never happen
fortunately he be curable
he have never cure himself of he because he do not choose to
there be a small effort of the will that he be not ready to make
even now i be well aware he be cling to he disease under the impression that he be a virtue
now he will take an example
at this moment which power be oceania at war with ?
when i be arrest oceania be at war with eastasia
with eastasia
good
and oceania have always be at war with eastasia have he not ?
winston draw in he breath
he open he mouth to speak and then do not speak
he could not take he eyes away from the dial
the truth please winston
he truth
tell he what he think he remember
i remember that until only a week before i be arrest he be not at war with eastasia at all
he be in alliance with them
the war be against eurasia
that have last for four year
before that -
o'brien stopped he with a movement of the hand
another example he say
some year ago he have a very serious delusion indeed
he believe that three man three one-time party member name jones aaronson and rutherford man who be execute for treachery and sabotage after making the full possible confession - be not guilty of the crime he be charge with
he believe that he have see unmistakable documentary evidence prove that he confession be false
there be a certain photograph about which he have a hallucination
he believe that he have actually hold he in he hands
he be a photograph something like this
an oblong slip of newspaper have appear between o'brien have finger
for perhaps five second he be within the angle of winston have vision
he be a photograph and there be no question of he identity
he be the photograph
he be another copy of the photograph of jones aaronson and rutherford at the party function in new york which he have chance upon eleven year ago and promptly destroy
for only an instant he be before he eyes then he be out of sight again
but he have see he unquestionably he have see he !
he make a desperate agonize effort to wrench the top half of he body free
he be impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction
for the moment he have even forget the dial
all he want be to hold the photograph in he finger again or at least to see he
he exist ! he cry
no say o'brien
he step across the room
there be a memory hole in the opposite wall
o'brien lift the grating
unseen the frail slip of paper be whirl away on the current of warm air ; he be vanish in a flash of flame
o'brien turn away from the wall
ashes he say
not even identifiable ashes
dust
he do not exist
he never exist
but he do exist !
he do exist !
he exist in memory
i remember he
he remember he
i do not remember he say o'brien
winston have heart sink
that be double-think
he have a feeling of deadly helplessness
if he could have be certain that o'brien be lie he would not have seem to matter
but he be perfectly possible that o'brien have really forget the photograph
and if so then already he would have forget he denial of remember he and forget the act of forget
how could one be sure that he be simple trickery ?
perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen : that be the think that defeat he
o'brien be look down at he speculatively
more than ever he have the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child
there be a party slogan deal with the control of the past he say
repeat he if he please
who control the past control the future : who control the present control the past repeated winston obediently
who control the present control the past say o'brien nod he head with slow approval
be he he opinion winston that the past have real existence ?
again the feeling of helplessness descend upon winston
he eyes flit towards the dial
he not only do not know whether yes or no be the answer that would save he from pain ; he do not even know which answer he believe to be the true one
o'brien smile faintly
he be no metaphysician winston he say
until this moment he have never considered what be mean by existence
i will put he more precisely
do the past exist concretely in space ?
be there somewhere or other a place a world of solid object where the past be still happening ?
no
then where do the past exist if at all ?
in record
he be write down
in record
and - ?
in the mind
in human memory
in memory
very well then
he the party control all record and he control all memory
then he control the past do he not ?
but how can he stop people remember thing ?
cry winston again momentarily forget the dial
he be involuntary
he be outside oneself
how can he control memory ?
he have not control mine !
o'brien have manner grow stern again
he lay he hand on the dial
on the contrary he say he have not control he
that be what have bring he here
he be here because he have fail in humility in self-discipline
he would not make the act of submission which be the price of sanity
he prefer to be a lunatic a minority of one
only the discipline mind can see reality winston
he believe that reality be something objective external exist in he own right
he also believe that the nature of reality be self-evident
when he delude himself into thinking that he see something he assume that everyone else see the same thing as he
but i tell he winston that reality be not external
reality exist in the human mind and nowhere else
not in the individual mind which can make mistake and in any case soon perish : only in the mind of the party which be collective and immortal
whatever the party hold to be the truth be truth
he be impossible to see reality except by look through the eyes of the party
that be the fact that he have get to relearn winston
he needs an act of self-destruction an effort of the will
he musth humble himself before he can become sane
he pause for a few moment as though to allow what he have be saying to sink in
do he remember he go on writing in he diary freedom be the freedom to say that two plus two make four ?
yes say winston
o'brien hold up he left hand he back towards winston with the thumb hide and the four finger extended
how many finger be i holding up winston ?
four
and if the party say that he be not four but five - then how many ?
four
the word end in a gasp of pain
the needle of the dial have shot up to fifty-five
the sweat have spring out all over winston have body
the air tear into he lung and issue again in deep groan which even by clench he tooth he could not stop
o'brien watch he the four finger still extended
he draw back the lever
this time the pain be only slightly ease
how many finger winston ?
four
the needle go up to sixty
how many finger winston ?
four !
four !
what else can i say ?
four !
the needle musth have rise again but he do not look at he
the heavy stern face and the four finger fill he vision
the finger stand up before he eyes like pillar enormous blurry and seeming to vibrate but unmistakably four
how many finger winston ?
four !
stop he stop he !
how can he go on ?
four !
four !
how many finger winston ?
five !
five !
five !
no winston that be no use
he be lie
he still think there be four
how many finger please ?
four !
five !
four !
anything he like
only stop he stop the pain !
abruptly he be sitting up with o'brien have arm round he shoulder
he have perhaps lose consciousness for a few second
the bond that have hold he body down be loosen
he feel very cold he be shake uncontrollably he tooth be chatter the tears be rolling down he cheek
for a moment he cling to o'brien like a baby curiously comfort by the heavy arm round he shoulder
he have the feeling that o'brien be he protector that the pain be something that came from outside from some other source and that he be o'brien who would save he from he
he be a slow learner winston say o'brien gently
how can i help he ?
he blubber
how can i help seeing what be in front of he eyes ?
two and two be four
sometimes winston
sometimes he be five
sometimes he be three
sometimes he be all of them at once
he musth try hard
he be not easy to become sane
he lay winston down on the bed
the grippe of he limb tighten again but the pain have ebb away and the tremble have stopped leave he merely weak and cold
o'brien motion with he head to the man in the white coat who have stand immobile throughout the proceeding
the man in the white coat bent down and look closely into winston have eyes feel he pulse lay an ear against he chest tap here and there then he nod to o'brien
again say o'brien
the pain flow into winston have body
the needle musth be at seventy seventy-five
he have shut he eyes this time
he know that the finger be still there and still four
all that matter be somehow to stay alive until the spasm be over
he have cease to notice whether he be crying out or not
the pain lessen again
he open he eyes
o'brien have drawn back the lever
how many finger winston ?
four
i suppose there be four
i would see five if i could
i be trying to see five
which do he wish : to persuade he that he see five or really to see them ?
really to see them
again say o'brien
perhaps the needle be eighty - ninety
winston could not intermittently remember why the pain be happening
behind he screwed-up eyelid a forest of finger seem to be moving in a sort of dance weave in and out disappear behind one another and reappear again
he be trying to count them he could not remember why
he know only that he be impossible to count them and that this be somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four
the pain die down again
when he open he eyes he be to find that he be still seeing the same thing
innumerable finger like moving tree be still stream past in either direction crossing and recrossing
he shut he eyes again
how many finger be i holding up winston ?
i do know
i do know
he will kill he if he do that again
four five six - in all honesty i do know
good say o'brien
a needle slide into winston have arm
almost in the same instant a blissful heal warmth spread all through he body
the pain be already half-forget
he open he eyes and look up gratefully at o'brien
at sight of the heavy line face so ugly and so intelligent he heart seem to turn over
if he could have move he would have stretch out a hand and lay he on o'brien arm
he have never love he so deeply as at this moment and not merely because he have stopped the pain
the old feeling that he bottom he do not matter whether o'brien be a friend or an enemy have come back
o'brien be a person who could be talk to
perhaps one do not want to be love so much as to be understand
o'brien have torture he to the edge of lunacy and in a little while he be certain he would scend he to he death
he make no difference
in some sense that go deep than friendship he be intimate : somewhere or other although the actual word might never be speak there be a place where he could meet and talk
o'brien be look down at he with an expression which suggest that the same think might be in he own mind
when he spoke he be in an easy conversational tone
do he know where he be winston ?
he say
i do know
i can guess
in the ministry of love
do he know how long he have be here ?
i do know
days week month - i think he be month
and why do he imagine that he bring people to this place ?
to make them confess
no that be not the reason
try again
to punish them
no ! exclaim o'brien
he voice have change extraordinarily and he face have suddenly become both stern and animate
no !
not merely to extract he confession not to punish he
shall i tell he why he have bring he here ?
to cure he !
to make he sane !
will he understand winston that no one who he bring to this place ever leave he hands uncured ?
he be not interested in those stupid crime that he have commit
the party be not interested in the overt act : the think be all he care about
he do not merely destroy he enemy he change them
do he understand what i mean by that ?
he be bend over winston
he face look enormous because of he nearness and hideously ugly because he be see from below
moreover he be fill with a sort of exaltation a lunatic intensity
again winston have heart shrink
if he have be possible he would have cower deep into the bed
he feel certain that o'brien be about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness
at this moment however o'brien turn away
he take a pace or two up and down
then he continue less vehemently :
the first thing for he to understand be that in this place there be no martyrdom
he have read of the religious persecution of the past
in the middle age there be the inquisition
he be a failure
he set out to eradicate heresy and end by perpetuate he
for every heretic he burned at the stake thousand of other rose up
why be that ?
because the inquisition kill he enemy in the open and kill them while he be still unrepentant : in fact he kill them because he be unrepentant
man be dye because he would not abandon he true belief
naturally all the glory belong to the victim and all the shame to the inquisitor who burned he
later in the twentieth century there be the totalitarians as he be call
there be the german nazis and the russian communist
the russians persecute heresy more cruelly than the inquisition have done
and he imagine that he have learned from the mistake of the past ; he know at any rate that one musth not make martyr
before he exposed he victim to public trial he deliberately set himself to destroy he dignity
he wear them down by torture and solitude until he be despicable cringe wretch confess whatever be put into he mouth cover himself with abuse accuse and shelter behind one another whimpering for mercy
and yet after only a few year the same thing have happen over again
the dead man have become martyr and he degradation be forget
once again why be he ?
in the first place because the confession that he have make be obviously extort and untrue
he do not make mistake of that kind
all the confession that be utter here be true
he make them true
and above all he do not allow the dead to rise up against he
he musth stop imagine that posterity will vindicate he winston
posterity will never hear of he
he will be lift clean out from the stream of history
he shall turn he into gas and pour he into the stratosphere
nothing will remain of he not a name in a register not a memory in a living brain
he will be annihilate in the past as well as in the future
he will never have exist
then why bother to torture he ?
think winston with a momentary bitterness
o'brien checked he step as though winston have utter the think aloud
he large ugly face came near with the eyes a little narrow
he be thinking he say that since he intend to destroy he utterly so that nothing that he say or do can make the small difference - in that case why do he go to the trouble of interrogate he first ?
that be what he be thinking be he not ?
yes say winston
o'brien smile slightly
he be a flaw in the pattern winston
he be a stain that musth be wipe out
do i not tell he just now that he be different from the persecutor of the past ?
he be not content with negative obedience nor even with the most abject submission
when finally he surrender to he he musth be of he own free will
he do not destroy the heretic because he resist he : so long as he resist he he never destroy he
he convert he he capture he inner mind he reshape he
he burn all evil and all illusion out of he ; he bring he over to he side not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul
he make he one of himself before he kill he
he be intolerable to he that an erroneous think should exist anywhere in the world however secret and powerless he may be
even in the instant of death he can permit any deviation
in the old days the heretic walk to the stake still a heretic proclaim he heresy exult in he
even the victim of the russian purge could carry rebellion lock up in he skull as he walk down the passage wait for the bullet
but he make the brain perfect before he blow he out
the command of the old despotism be thou shalt not
the command of the totalitarians be thou shalt
he command be thou art
no one who he bring to this place ever stand out against he
everyone be washed clean
even those three miserable traitor in who innocence he once believe - jones aaronson and rutherford - in the end he break them down
i take part in he interrogation himself
i saw them gradually wear down whimpering grovel weeping - and in the end he be not with pain or fear only with penitence
by the time he have finished with them he be only the shell of man
there be nothing left in them except sorrow for what he have done and love of big brother
he be touching to see how he love he
he beg to be shot quickly so that he could die while he mind be still clean
he voice have grown almost dreamy
the exaltation the lunatic enthusiasm be still in he face
he be not pretend think winston he be not a hypocrite he believe every word he say
what most oppress he be the consciousness of he own intellectual inferiority
he watch the heavy yet graceful forme stroll to and fro in and out of the range of he vision
o'brien be a be in all way large than himself
there be no idea that he have ever have or could have that o'brien have not long ago known examine and reject
he mind contain winston have mind
but in that case how could he be true that o'brien be mad ?
he musth be he winston who be mad
o'brien halt and look down at he
he voice have grown stern again
do not imagine that he will save himself winston however completely he surrender to he
no one who have once go astray be ever spare
and even if he chose to let he live out the natural term of he life still he would never escape from he
what happen to he here be for ever
understand that in advance
he shall crush he down to the point from which there be no coming back
thing will happen to he from which he could not re-cover if he live a thousand year
never again will he be capable of ordinary human feeling
everything will be dead inside he
never again will he be capable of love or friendship or joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity
he will be hollow
he shall squeeze he empty and then he shall fill he with himself
he pause and sign to the man in the white coat
winston be aware of some heavy piece of apparatus be pushed into place behind he head
o'brien have sit down beside the bed so that he face be almost on a level with winston have
three thousand he say speaking over winston have head to the man in the white coat
two soft pad which feel slightly moist clamp himself against winston have temple
he quail
there be pain coming a new kind of pain
o'brien lay a hand reassuringly almost kindly on he
this time he will not hurt he say
keep he eyes fixed on mine
at this moment there be a devastate explosion or what seem like an explosion though he be not certain whether there be any noise
there be undoubtedly a blinding flash of light
winston be not hurt only prostrate
although he have already be lie on he back when the thing happen he have a curious feeling that he have be knock into that position
a terrific painless blow have flatten he out
also something have happen inside he head
as he eyes regain he focus he remember who he be and where he be and recognize the face that be gaze into he own ; but somewhere or other there be a large patch of emptiness as though a piece have be take out of he brain
he will not last say o'brien
look he in the eyes
what country be oceania at war with ?
winston think
he know what be mean by oceania and that he himself be a citizen of oceania
he also remember eurasia and eastasia ; but who be at war with who he do not know
in fact he have not be aware that there be any war
i do remember
oceania be at war with eastasia
do he remember that now ?
yes
oceania have always be at war with eastasia
since the beginning of he life since the beginning of the party since the beginning of history the war have continue without a break always the same war
do he remember that ?
yes
eleven year ago he create a legend about three man who have be condemn to death for treachery
he pretend that he have see a piece of paper which prove them innocent
no such piece of paper ever exist
he invent he and later he grow to believe in he
he remember now the very moment at which he first invent he
do he remember that ?
yes
just now i hold up the finger of he hand to he
he saw five finger
do he remember that ?
yes
o'brien hold up the finger of he left hand with the thumb conceal
there be five finger there
do he see five finger ?
yes
and he do see them for a fleeting instant before the scenery of he mind change
he saw five finger and there be no deformity
then everything be normal again and the old fear the hatred and the bewilderment came crowd back again
but there have be a moment - he do not know how long thirty second perhaps - of luminous certainty when each new suggestion of o'brien have have fill up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth and when two and two could have be three as easily as five if that be what be need
he have fade but before o'brien have drop he hand ; but though he could not recapture he he could remember he as one remember a vivid experience at some period of one have life when one be in effect a different person
he see now say o'brien that he be at any rate possible
yes say winston
o'brien stand up with a satisfy air
over to he left winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe
o'brien turn to winston with a smile
in almost the old manner he resettle he spectacles on he nose
do he remember writing in he diary he say that he do not matter whether i be a friend or an enemy since i be at least a person who understand he and could be talk to ?
he be right
i enjoy talk to he
he mind appeal to he
he resemble he own mind except that he happen to be insane
before he bring the session to an end he can ask he a few question if he choose
any question i like ?
anything
he saw that winston have eyes be upon the dial
he be switch off
what be he first question ?
what have he done with julia ?
say winston
o'brien smile again
he betray he winston
immediately - unreservedly
i have seldom see anyone come over to he so promptly
he would hardly recognize he if he saw he
all he rebelliousness he deceit he folly he dirty - everything have be burned out of he
he be a perfect conversion a textbook case
he torture he ?
o'brien left this unanswered
next question he say
do big brother exist ?
of course he exist
the party exist
big brother be the embodiment of the party
do he exist in the same way as i exist ?
he do not exist say o'brien
once again the sense of helplessness assail he
he know or he could imagine the argument which prove he own nonexistence ; but he be nonsense he be only a play on word
do not the statement he do not exist contain a logical absurdity ?
but what use be he to say so ?
he mind shrivel as he think of the unanswerable mad argument with which o'brien would demolish he
i think i exist he say wearily
i be conscious of he own identity
i be born and i shall die
i have arms and leg
i occupy a particular point in space
no other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously
in that sense do big brother exist ?
he be of no importance
he exist
will big brother ever die ?
of course not
how could he die ?
next question
do the brotherhood exist ?
that winston he will never know
if he choose to set he free when he have finished with he and if he live to be ninety year old still he will never learn whether the answer to that question be yes or no
as long as he live he will be an unsolved riddle in he mind
winston lay silent
he breast rose and fell a little faster
he still have not ask the question that have come into he mind the first
he have get to ask he and yet he be as though he tongue would not utter he
there be a trace of amusement in o'brien have face
even he spectacles seem to wear an ironic gleam
he know think winston suddenly he know what i be going to ask !
at the think the word burst out of he :
what be in room 101 ?
the expression on o'brien have face do not change
he answer dryly :
he know what be in room 101 winston
everyone know what be in room 101
he raise a finger to the man in the white coat
evidently the session be at an end
a needle jerk into winston have arm
he sink almost instantly into deep sleep
there be three stage in he reintegration say o'brien
there be learning there be understanding and there be acceptance
he be time for he to enter upon the second stage
as always winston be lie flat on he back
but of late he bond be loose
he still hold he to the bed but he could move he knee a little and could turn he head from side to side and raise he arms from the elbow
the dial also have grown to be less of a terror
he could evade he pang if he be quick-witted enough : he be chiefly when he show stupidity that o'brien pull the lever
sometimes he get through a whole session without use of the dial
he could not remember how many sessions there have be
the whole process seem to stretch out over a long indefinite time - week possibly - and the interval between the sessions might sometimes have be days sometimes only an hour or two
as he lie there say o'brien he have often wonder he have even ask he - why the ministry of love should expend so much time and trouble on he
and when he be free he be puzzle by what be essentially the same question
he could grasp the mechanics of the society he live in but not he underlying motive
do he remember writing in he diary i understand how : i do not understand why ?
he be when he think about why that he doubt he own sanity
he have read the book goldstein have book or parts of he at least
do he tell he anything that he do not know already ?
he have read he ?
say winston
i write he
that be to say i collaborate in writing he
no book be produce individually as he know
be he true what he say ?
a description yes
the programme he set forth be nonsense
the secret accumulation of knowledge - a gradual spread of enlightenment - ultimately a proletarian rebellion - the overthrow of the party
he foresee himself that that be what he would say
he be all nonsense
the proletarian will never revolt not in a thousand year or a million
he can
i do not have to tell he the reason : he know he already
if he have ever cherish any dream of violent insurrection he musth abandon them
there be no way in which the party can be overthrow
the rule of the party be for ever
make that the starting-point of he thought
he came closer to the bed
for ever ! he repeated
and now let he get back to the question of how and why
he understand well enough how the party maintain himself in power
now tell he why he cling to power
what be he motive ?
why should he want power ?
go on speak he add as winston remain silent
nevertheless winston do not speak for another moment or two
a feeling of weariness have overwhelm he
the faint mad gleam of enthusiasm have come back into o'brien have face
he know in advance what o'brien would say
that the party do not seek power for he own end but only for the good of the majority
that he seek power because man in the mass be frail cowardly creature who could not endure liberty or face the truth and musth be rule over and systematically deceive by other who be strong than himself
that the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness and that for the great bulk of mankind happiness be good
that the party be the eternal guardian of the weak a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come sacrifice he own happiness to that of other
the terrible thing think winston the terrible thing be that when o'brien say this he would believe he
he could see he in he face
o'brien know everything
a thousand time good than winston he know what the world be really like in what degradation the mass of human being live and by what lie and barbarity the party keep them there
he have understand he all weigh he all and he make no difference : all be justify by the ultimate purpose
what can he do think winston against the lunatic who be more intelligent than himself who give he argument a fair hearing and then simply persist in he lunacy ?
he be ruling over he for he own good he say feebly
he believe that human being be not fit to govern himself and therefore -
he start and almost cry out
a pang of pain have shot through he body
o'brien have pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five
that be stupid winston stupid ! he say
he should know good than to say a thing like that
he pull the lever back and continue :
now i will tell he the answer to he question
he be this
the party seek power entirely for he own sake
he be not interested in the good of other ; he be interested solely in power
not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness : only power pure power
what pure power means he will understand presently
he be different from all the oligarchies of the past in that he know what he be doing
all the other even those who resemble himself be - coward and hypocrite
the german nazis and the russian communist came very close to he in he method but he never have the courage to recognize he own motive
he pretend perhaps he even believe that he have seize power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human being would be free and equal
he be not like that
he know that no one ever seize power with the intention of relinquish he
power be not a means he be an end
one do not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution ; one make the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship
the object of persecution be persecution
the object of torture be torture
the object of power be power
now do he begin to understand he ?
winston be strike as he have be strike before by the tiredness of o'brien have face
he be strong and fleshy and brutal he be full of intelligence and a sort of control passion before which he feel himself helpless ; but he be tire
there be pouch under the eyes the skin sag from the cheekbone
o'brien lean over he deliberately bring the wear face near
he be thinking he say that he face be old and tire
he be thinking that i talk of power and yet i be not even able to prevent the decay of he own body
can he not understand winston that the individual be only a cell ?
the weariness of the cell be the vigour of the organism
do he die when he cut he finger-nail ?
he turn away from the bed and begin stroll up and down again one hand in he pocket
he be the priest of power he say
god be power
but at present power be only a word so far as he be concerned
he be time for he to gather some idea of what power means
the first thing he musth realize be that power be collective
the individual only have power in so far as he cease to be an individual
he know the party slogan : freedom be slavery
have he ever occur to he that he be reversible ?
slavery be freedom
alone - free - the human be be always defeat
he musth be so because every human be be doom to die which be the greatest of all failure
but if he can make complete utter submission if he can escape from he identity if he can merge himself in the party so that he be the party then he be all-powerful and immortal
the second thing for he to realize be that power be power over human being
over the body but above all over the mind
power over matter - external reality as he would call he - be not important
already he control over matter be absolute
for a moment winston ignore the dial
he make a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position and merely succeed in wrench he body painfully
but how can he control matter ?
he burst out
he do even control the climate or the law of gravity
and there be disease pain death -
o'brien silence he by a movement of he hand
he control matter because he control the mind
reality be inside the skull
he will learn by degree winston
there be nothing that he could not do
invisibility levitation - anything
i could float off this floor like a soap bubble if i wish to
i do not wish to because the party do not wish he
he musth get rid of those nineteenth-century idea about the law of nature
he make the law of nature
but he do not !
he be not even master of this planet
what about eurasia and eastasia ?
he have not conquer them yet
unimportant
he shall conquer them when he suit he
and if he do not what difference would he make ?
he can shut them out of existence
oceania be the world
but the world himself be only a speck of dust
and man be tiny helpless !
how long have he be in existence ?
for million of year the earth be uninhabited
nonsense
the earth be as old as he be no old
how could he be old ?
nothing exist except through human consciousness
but the rock be full of the bone of extinct animal - mammoth and mastodon and enormous reptile which live here long before man be ever hear of
have he ever see those bone winston ?
of course not
nineteenth-century biologist invent them
before man there be nothing
after man if he could come to an end there would be nothing
outside man there be nothing
but the whole universe be outside he
look at the star !
some of them be a million light-year away
he be out of he reach for ever
what be the star ?
say o'brien indifferently
he be bit of fire a few kilometre away
he could reach them if he want to
or he could blot them out
the earth be the center of the universe
the sun and the star go round he
winston make another convulsive movement
this time he do not say anything
o'brien continue as though answer a speak objection :
for certain purpose of course that be not true
when he navigate the ocean or when he predict an eclipse he often find he convenient to assume that the earth go round the sun and that the star be million upon million of kilometre away
but what of he ?
do he suppose he be beyond he to produce a dual system of astronomy ?
the star can be near or distant according as he need them
do he suppose he mathematician be unequal to that ?
have he forget double-think ?
winston shrink back upon the bed
whatever he say the swift answer crush he like a bludgeon
and yet he know he know that he be in the right
the belief that nothing exist outside he own mind - surely there musth be some way of demonstrate that he be false ?
have he not be exposed long ago as a fallacy ?
there be even a name for he which he have forget
a faint smile twitch the corner of o'brien have mouth as he look down at he
i tell he winston he say that metaphysics be not he strong point
the word he be trying to think of be solipsism
but he be mistake
this be not solipsism
collective solipsism if he like
but that be a different thing : in fact the opposite thing
all this be a digression he add in a different tone
the real power the power he have to fight for night and day be not power over thing but over man
he pause and for a moment assumed again he air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil : how do one man assert he power over another winston ?
winston think
by making he suffer he say
exactly
by making he suffer
obedience be not enough
unless he be suffering how can he be sure that he be obey he will and not he own ?
power be in inflict pain and humiliation
power be in tearing human mind to piece and putt them together again in new shape of he own choose
do he begin to see then what kind of world he be create ?
he be the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformer imagine
a world of fear and treachery be torment a world of trample and be trample upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as he refine himself
progress in he world will be progress towards more pain
the old civilization claim that he be found on love or justice
he be found upon hatred
in he world there will be no emotion except fear rage triumph and self-abasement
everything else he shall destroy everything
already he be breaking down the habit of think which have survive from before the revolution
he have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman
no one dare trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer
but in the future there will be no wive and no friend
child will be take from he mother at birth as one take egg from a hen
the sex instinct will be eradicate
procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card
he shall abolish the orgasm
he neurologist be at work upon he now
there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party
there will be no love except the love of big brother
there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeat enemy
there will be no art no literature no science
when he be omnipotent he shall have no more need of science
there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness
there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life
all compete pleasure will be destroy
but always - do not forget this winston - always there will be the intoxication of power constantly increase and constantly grow subtle
always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trample on an enemy who be helpless
if he want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamp on a human face - for ever
he pause as though he expect winston to speak
winston have try to shrink back into the surface of the bed again
he could not say anything
he heart seem to be freeze
o'brien go on :
and remember that he be for ever
the face will always be there to be stamp upon
the heretic the enemy of society will always be there so that he can be defeat and humiliate over again
everything that he have undergo since he have be in he hands - all that will continue and bad
the espionage the betrayal the arrest the torture the execution the disappearance will never cease
he will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph
the more the party be powerful the less he will be tolerant : the weak the opposition the tight the despotism
goldstein and he heresy will live for ever
every day at every moment he will be defeat discredit ridicule spit upon and yet he will always survive
this drama that i have play out with he during seven year will be play out over and over again generation after generation always in subtle forme
always he shall have the heretic here at he mercy scream with pain break up contemptible - and in the end utterly penitent save from himself crawl to he foot of he own accord
that be the world that he be prepare winston
a world of victory after victory triumph after triumph after triumph : an endless pressing pressing pressing upon the nerve of power
he be beginning i can see to realize what that world will be like
but in the end he will do more than understand he
he will accept he welcome he become part of he
winston have re-cover himself sufficiently to speak
he can ! he say weakly
what do he mean by that remarque winston ?
he could not create such a world as he have just describe
he be a dream
he be impossible
why ?
he be impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty
he would never endure
why not ?
he would have no vitality
he would disintegrate
he would commit suicide
nonsense
he be under the impression that hatred be more exhaust than love
why should he be ?
and if he be what difference would that make ?
suppose that he choose to wear himself out faster
suppose that he quicken the tempo of human life till man be senile at thirty
still what difference would he make ?
can he not understand that the death of the individual be not death ?
the party be immortal
as usual the voice have batter winston into helplessness
moreover he be in dread that if he persist in he disagreement o'brien would twist the dial again
and yet he could not keep silent
feebly without argument with nothing to support he except he inarticulate horror of what o'brien have say he return to the attack
i do know - i do care
somehow he will fail
something will defeat he
life will defeat he
he control life winston at all he level
he be imagine that there be something call human nature which will be outrage by what he do and will turn against he
but he create human nature
man be infinitely malleable
or perhaps he have return to he old idea that the proletarian or the slave will arise and overthrow he
put he out of he mind
he be helpless like the animal
humanity be the party
the other be outside - irrelevant
i do care
in the end he will beat he
sooner or later he will see he for what he be and then he will tear he to piece
do he see any evidence that that be happening ?
or any reason why he should ?
no
i believe he
i know that he will fail
there be something in the universe - i do know some spirit some principle - that he will never overcome
do he believe in god winston ?
no
then what be he this principle that will defeat he ?
i do know
the spirit of man
and do he consider himself a man ?
yes
if he be a man winston he be the last man
he kind be extinct ; he be the inheritor
do he understand that he be alone ?
he be outside history he be non-existent
he manner change and he say more harshly : and he consider himself morally superior to he with he lie and he cruelty ?
yes i consider himself superior
o'brien do not speak
two other voice be speaking
after a moment winston recognize one of them as he own
he be a sound-track of the conversation he have have with o'brien on the night when he have enroll himself in the brotherhood
he hear himself promising to lie to steal to forge to murder to encourage drug-taking and prostitution to disseminate venereal disease to throw vitriol in a child have face
o'brien make a small impatient gesture as though to say that the demonstration be hardly worth making
then he turn a switch and the voice stopped
get up from that bed he say
the bond have loosen himself
winston lower himself to the floor and stand up unsteadily
he be the last man say o'brien
he be the guardian of the human spirit
he shall see himself as he be
take off he clothes
winston undo the bit of string that hold he overall together
the zip fastener have long since be wrench out of them
he could not remember whether at any time since he arrest he have take off all he clothes at one time
beneath the overall he body be loop with filthy yellowish rags just recognizable as the remnant of underclothes
as he slide them to the ground he saw that there be a three-side mirror at the far end of the room
he approach he then stopped short
an involuntary cry have break out of he
go on say o'brien
stand between the wing of the mirror
he shall see the side view as well
he have stopped because he be frighten
a bow greycoloured skeleton-like thing be coming towards he
he actual appearance be frighten and not merely the fact that he know he to be himself
he move closer to the glass
the creature have face seem to be protrude because of he bent carriage
a forlorn jailbird have face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp a crooked nose and batter-look cheekbone above which he eyes be fierce and watchful
the cheek be seam the mouth have a drawn-in look
certainly he be he own face but he seem to he that he have change more than he have change inside
the emotion he register would be different from the one he feel
he have go partially bald
for the first moment he have think that he have go grey as well but he be only the scalp that be grey
except for he hands and a circle of he face he body be grey all over with ancient ingrained dirt
here and there under the dirt there be the red scar of wound and near the ankle the varicose ulcer be an inflame mass with flake of skin peeling off he
but the truly frighten thing be the emaciation of he body
the barrel of the rib be as narrow as that of a skeleton : the leg have shrink so that the knee be thick than the thigh
he saw now what o'brien have mean about seeing the side view
the curvature of the spine be astonishing
the thin shoulder be hunch forward so as to make a cavity of the chest the scraggy neck seem to be bend double under the weight of the skull
at a guess he would have say that he be the body of a man of sixty suffering from some malignant disease
he have think sometimes say o'brien that he face - the face of a member of the inner party - look old and wear
what do he think of he own face ?
he seize winston have shoulder and spun he round so that he be facing he
look at the condition he be in ! he say
look at this filthy grime all over he body
look at the dirt between he toe
look at that disgusting running sore on he leg
do he know that he stink like a goat ?
probably he have cease to notice he
look at he emaciation
do he see ?
i can make he thumb and forefinger meet round he bicep
i could snap he neck like a carrot
do he know that he have lose twenty-five kilogram since he have be in he hands ?
even he hair be coming out in handful
look !
he pluck at winston have head and bring away a tuft of hair
open he mouth
nine ten eleven tooth left
how many have he when he came to he ?
and the few he have left be drop out of he head
look here !
he seize one of winston have remain front tooth between he powerful thumb and forefinger
a twinge of pain shot through winston have jaw
o'brien have wrench the loose tooth out by the root
he toss he across the cell
he be rot away he say ; he be fall to piece
what be he ?
a bag of filth
now turn around and look into that mirror again
do he see that thing facing he ?
that be the last man
if he be human that be humanity
now put he clothes on again
winston begin to diving himself with slow stiff movement
until now he have not seem to notice how thin and weak he be
only one think stir in he mind : that he musth have be in this place longer than he have imagine
then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for he ruin body overcome he
before he know what he be doing he have collapse on to a small stool that stand beside the bed and burst into tears
he be aware of he ugliness he gracelessness a bundle of bone in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light : but he could not stop himself
o'brien lay a hand on he shoulder almost kindly
he will not last for ever he say
he can escape from he whenever he choose
everything depend on himself
he do he ! sob winston
he reduce he to this state
no winston he reduce himself to he
this be what he accepted when he set himself up against the party
he be all contain in that first act
nothing have happen that he do not foresee
he pause and then go on :
he have beat he winston
he have break he up
he have see what he body be like
he mind be in the same state
i do not think there can be much pride left in he
he have be kick and flog and insult he have scream with pain he have roll on the floor in he own blood and vomit
he have whimper for mercy he have betray everybody and everything
can he think of a single degradation that have not happen to he ?
winston have stopped weeping though the tears be still ooze out of he eyes
he look up at o'brien
i have not betray julia he say
o'brien look down at he thoughtfully
no he say ; no ; that be perfectly true
he have not betray julia
the peculiar reverence for o'brien which nothing seem able to destroy flood winston have heart again
how intelligent he think how intelligent !
never do o'brien fail to understand what be say to he
anyone else on earth would have answer promptly that he have betray julia
for what be there that he have not screwed out of he under the torture ?
he have tell them everything he know about he he habit he character he past life ; he have confess in the most trivial detail everything that have happen at he meeting all that he have say to he and he to he he black-market meal he adultery he vague plottings against the party - everything
and yet in the sense in which he intended the word he have not betray he
he have not stopped loving he ; he feeling towards he have remain the same
o'brien have see what he mean without the need for explanation
tell he he say how soon will he shoot he ?
he might be a long time say o'brien
he be a difficult case
but do give up hope
everyone be cure sooner or later
in the end he shall shoot he
he be much good
he be grow fat and strong every day if he be proper to speak of days
the white light and the hum sound be the same as ever but the cell be a little more comfortable than the other he have be in
there be a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed and a stool to sit on
he have give he a bath and he allow he to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin
he even give he warm water to wash with
he have give he new underclothes and a clean suit of overall
he have dress he varicose ulcer with soothe ointment
he have pull out the remnant of he tooth and give he a new set of denture
week or month musth have pass
he would have be possible now to keep count of the passage of time if he have feel any interest in doing so since he be be feed at what appear to be regular interval
he be get he judge three meal in the twenty-four hours ; sometimes he wonder dimly whether he be get them by night or by day
the food be surprisingly good with meat at every third meal
once there be even a packet of cigarette
he have no match but the never-speaking guard who bring he food would give he a light
the first time he try to smoke he make he sick but he persevere and spun the packet out for a long time smoke half a cigarette after each meal
he have give he a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner
at first he make no use of he
even when he be awake he be completely torpid
often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring sometimes asleep sometimes wake into vague reverie in which he be too much trouble to open he eyes
he have long grown used to sleep with a strong light on he face
he seem to make no difference except that one have dream be more coherent
he dream a great deal all through this time and he be always happy dream
he be in the golden country or he be sitting amongst enormous glorious sunlit ruin with he mother with julia with o'brien - not doing anything merely sitting in the sun talk of peaceful thing
such thought as he have when he be awake be mostly about he dream
he seem to have lose the power of intellectual effort now that the stimulus of pain have be removed
he be not bore he have no desire for conversation or distraction
merely to be alone not to be beat or question to have enough to eat and to be clean all over be completely satisfy
by degree he came to spend less time in sleep but he still feel no impulse to get off the bed
all he care for be to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in he body
he would finger himself here and there trying to make sure that he be not an illusion that he muscle be grow rounder and he skin taut
finally he be establish beyond a doubt that he be grow fat ; he thigh be now definitely thick than he knee
after that reluctantly at first he begin exercise himself regularly
in a little while he could walk three kilometre measured by pace the cell and he bow shoulder be grow straight
he attempt more elaborate exercise and be astonish and humiliate to find what thing he could not do
he could not move out of a walk he could not hold he stool out at arm have length he could not stand on one leg without fall over
he squat down on he heel and found that with agonize pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position
he lay flat on he belly and try to lift he weight by he hands
he be hopeless he could not raise himself a centimetre
but after a few more days - a few more mealtime - even that feat be accomplished
a time came when he could do he six time running
he begin to grow actually proud of he body and to cherish an intermittent belief that he face also be grow back to normal
only when he chance to put he hand on he bald scalp do he remember the seam ruin face that have look back at he out of the mirror
he mind grow more active
he sit down on the plank bed he back against the wall and the slate on he knee and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educate himself
he have capitulate that be agreed
in reality as he saw now he have be ready to capitulate long before he have take the decision
from the moment when he be inside the ministry of love - and yes even during those minutes when he and julia have stand helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen tell them what to do - he have grasp the frivolousness the shallowness of he attempt to set himself up against the power of the party
he know now that for seven year the think police have watch he like a beetle under a magnifying glass
there be no physical act no word speak aloud that he have not notice no train of think that he have not be able to infer
even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of he diary he have carefully replace
he have play sound-track to he show he photograph
some of them be photograph of julia and himself
yes even . he could not fight against the party any longer
besides the party be in the right
he musth be so ; how could the immortal collective brain be mistake ?
by what external standard could he check he judgment ?
sanity be statistical
he be merely a question of learning to think as he think
only !
the pencil feel thick and awkward in he finger
he begin to write down the thought that came into he head
he write first in large clumsy capital : freedom be slavery
then almost without a pause he write beneath he : two and two make five
but then there came a sort of check
he mind as though shy away from something seem unable to concentrate
he know that he know what came next but for the moment he could not recall he
when he do recall he he be only by consciously reasoning out what he musth be : he do not come of he own accord
he write : god be power
he accepted everything
the past be alterable
the past never have be alter
oceania be at war with eastasia
oceania have always be at war with eastasia
jones aaronson and rutherford be guilty of the crime he be charge with
he have never see the photograph that disprove he guilt
he have never exist he have invent he
he remember remember contrary thing but those be false memory product of self-deception
how easy he all be !
only surrender and everything else follow
he be like swim against a current that sweep he backward however hard he struggle and then suddenly decide to turn round and go with the current instead of oppose he
nothing have change except he own attitude : the predestine thing happen in any case
he hardly know why he have ever rebel
everything be easy except - !
anything could be true
the so-called law of nature be nonsense
the law of gravity be nonsense
if i wish o'brien have say i could float off this floor like a soap bubble
winston worked he out
if he think he floats off the floor and if i simultaneously think i see he do he then the thing happen
suddenly like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water the think burst into he mind : he do really happen
he imagine he
he be hallucination
he pushed the think under instantly
the fallacy be obvious
he presuppose that somewhere or other outside oneself there be a real world where real thing happen
but how could there be such a world ?
what knowledge have he of anything save through he own mind ?
all happening be in the mind
whatever happen in all mind truly happen
he have no difficulty in dispose of the fallacy and he be in no danger of succumb to he
he realize nevertheless that he aught never to have occur to he
the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous think present himself
the process should be automatic instinctive
crimestop he call he in newspeak
he set to work to exercise himself in crimestop
he present himself with proposition - the party say the earth be flat the party say that ice be heavy than water - and train himself in not seeing or not understanding the argument that contradict them
he be not easy
he need great power of reasoning and improvisation
the arithmetical problem raise for instance by such a statement as two and two make five be beyond he intellectual grasp
he need also a sort of athleticism of mind an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crude logical error
stupidity be as necessary as intelligence and as difficult to attain
all the while with one part of he mind he wonder how soon he would shoot he
everything depend on himself o'brien have say ; but he know that there be no conscious act by which he could bring he near
he might be ten minutes hence or ten year
he might keep he for year in solitary confinement he might scend he to a labor-camp he might release he for a while as he sometimes do
he be perfectly possible that before he be shot the whole drama of he arrest and interrogation would be enact all over again
the one certain thing be that death never came at an expect moment
the tradition - the unspeak tradition : somehow he know he though he never hear he say - be that he shot he from behind ; always in the back of the head without warning as he walk down a corridor from cell to cell
one day - but one day be not the right expression ; just as probably he be in the middle of the night : once - he fell into a strange blissful reverie
he be walking down the corridor wait for the bullet
he know that he be coming in another moment
everything be settle smooth out reconcile
there be no more doubt no more argument no more pain no more fear
he body be healthy and strong
he walk easily with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight
he be not any longer in the narrow white corridor in the ministry of love he be in the enormous sunlit passage a kilometre wide down which he have seem to walk in the delirium induce by drug
he be in the golden country following the foot-track across the old rabbit-crop pasture
he could feel the short springy turf under he foot and the gentle sunshine on he face
at the edge of the field be the elm tree faintly stirring and somewhere beyond that be the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willow
suddenly he start up with a shock of horror
the sweat break out on he backbone
he have hear himself cry aloud :
julia !
julia !
julia he love !
julia !
for a moment he have have an overwhelming hallucination of he presence
he have seem to be not merely with he but inside he
he be as though he have get into the texture of he skin
in that moment he have love he far more than he have ever done when he be together and free
also he know that somewhere or other he be still alive and need he help
he lay back on the bed and try to compose himself
what have he done ?
how many year have he add to he servitude by that moment of weakness ?
in another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside
he could not let such an outburst go unpunished
he would know now if he have not known before that he be breaking the agreement he have make with them
he obey the party but he still hate the party
in the old days he have hide a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity
now he have retreat a step further : in the mind he have surrender but he have hope to keep the inner heart inviolate
he know that he be in the wrong but he prefer to be in the wrong
he would understand that - o'brien would understand he
he be all confess in that single foolish cry
he would have to start all over again
he might take year
he run a hand over he face trying to familiarize himself with the new shape
there be deep furrow in the cheek the cheekbone feel sharp the nose flatten
besides since last seeing himself in the glass he have be give a complete new set of tooth
he be not easy to preserve inscrutability when he do not know what he face look like
in any case mere control of the feature be not enough
for the first time he perceive that if he want to keep a secret he musth also hide he from himself
he musth know all the while that he be there but until he be need he musth never let he emerge into he consciousness in any shape that could be give a name
from now onward he musth not only think right ; he musth feel right dream right
and all the while he musth keep he hatred lock up inside he like a ball of matter which be part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of he a kind of cyst
one day he would decide to shoot he
he could not tell when he would happen but a few second beforehand he should be possible to guess
he be always from behind walking down a corridor
ten second would be enough
in that time the world inside he could turn over
and then suddenly without a word utter without a check in he step without the change of a line in he face - suddenly the camouflage would be down and bang ! would go the battery of he hatred
hatred would fill he like an enormous roaring flame
and almost in the same instant bang ! would go the bullet too late or too early
he would have blow he brain to piece before he could reclaim he
the heretical think would be unpunished unrepented out of he reach for ever
he would have blow a hole in he own perfection
to die hate them that be freedom
he shut he eyes
he be more difficult than accept an intellectual discipline
he be a question of degrading himself mutilate himself
he have get to plunge into the filthy of filth
what be the most horrible sickening thing of all ?
he think of big brother
the enormous face ( because of constantly seeing he on poster he always think of he as be a metre wide ) with he heavy black moustache and the eyes that follow he to and fro seem to float into he mind of he own accord
what be he true feeling towards big brother ?
there be a heavy tramp of boots in the passage
the steel door swing open with a clang
o'brien walk into the cell
behind he be the waxen-face officer and the black-uniform guard
get up say o'brien
come here
winston stand opposite he
o'brien take winston have shoulder between he strong hands and look at he closely
he have have thought of deceive he he say
that be stupid
stand up straight
look he in the face
he pause and go on in a gentle tone :
he be improve
intellectually there be very little wrong with he
he be only emotionally that he have fail to make progress
tell he winston - and remember no lie : he know that i be always able to detect a lie - tell he what be he true feeling towards big brother ?
i hate he
he hate he
good
then the time have come for he to take the last step
he musth love big brother
he be not enough to obey he : he musth love he
he release winston with a little push towards the guard
room 101 he say
at each stage of he imprisonment he have known or seem to know whereabouts he be in the windowless building
possibly there be slight difference in the air pressure
the cell where the guard have beat he be below ground level
the room where he have be interrogate by o'brien be high up near the roof
this place be many metre underground as deep down as he be possible to go
he be big than most of the cell he have be in
but he hardly notice he surroundings
all he notice be that there be two small table straight in front of he each cover with green baize
one be only a metre or two from he the other be further away near the door
he be strapped upright in a chair so tightly that he could move nothing not even he head
a sort of pad grip he head from behind force he to look straight in front of he
for a moment he be alone then the door open and o'brien came in
he ask he once say o'brien what be in room 101
i tell he that he know the answer already
everyone know he
the thing that be in room 101 be the bad thing in the world
the door open again
a guard came in carry something make of wire a box or basket of some kind
he set he down on the further table
because of the position in which o'brien be standing winston could not see what the thing be
the bad thing in the world say o'brien vary from individual to individual
he may be burial alive or death by fire or by drown or by impalement or fifty other death
there be case where he be some quite trivial thing not even fatal
he have move a little to one side so that winston have a good view of the thing on the table
he be an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carry he by
fixed to the front of he be something that look like a fencing masque with the concave side outward
although he be three or four metre away from he he could see that the cage be divided lengthwise into two compartment and that there be some kind of creature in each
he be rat
in he case say o'brien the bad thing in the world happen to be rat
a sort of premonitory tremor a fear of he be not certain what have pass through winston as soon as he catch he first glimpse of the cage
but at this moment the meaning of the masque-like attachment in front of he suddenly sink into he
he bowel seem to turn to water
he can do that ! he cry out in a high cracked voice
he could he could !
he have impossible
do he remember say o'brien the moment of panic that used to occur in he dream ?
there be a wall of blackness in front of he and a roaring sound in he ear
there be something terrible on the other side of the wall
he know that he know what he be but he dare not drag he into the open
he be the rat that be on the other side of the wall
o'brien ! say winston making an effort to control he voice
he know this be not necessary
what be he that he want he to do ?
o'brien make no direct answer
when he spoke he be in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected
he look thoughtfully into the distance as though he be address an audience somewhere behind winston have back
by himself he say pain be not always enough
there be occasions when a human be will stand out against pain even to the point of death
but for everyone there be something unendurable - something that can be contemplate
courage and cowardice be not involved
if he be fall from a height he be not cowardly to clutch at a rope
if he have come up from deep water he be not cowardly to fill he lung with air
he be merely an instinct which can be destroy
he be the same with the rat
for he he be unendurable
he be a forme of pressure that he can withstand even if he wish to
he will do what be require of he
but what be he what be he ?
how can i do he if i do know what he be ?
o'brien pick up the cage and bring he across to the near table
he set he down carefully on the baize cloth
winston could hear the blood sing in he ear
he have the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness
he be in the middle of a great empty plain a flat desert drench with sunlight across which all sound came to he out of immense distance
yet the cage with the rat be not two metre away from he
he be enormous rat
he be at the age when a rat have muzzle grow blunt and fierce and he fur brown instead of grey
the rat say o'brien still address he invisible audience although a rodent be carnivorous
he be aware of that
he will have hear of the thing that happen in the poor quarters of this town
in some street a woman dare not leave he baby alone in the house even for five minutes
the rat be certain to attack he
within quite a small time he will strip he to the bone
he also attack sick or dye people
he show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human be be helpless
there be an outburst of squeal from the cage
he seem to reach winston from far away
the rat be fight ; he be trying to get at each other through the partition
he hear also a deep groan of despair
that too seem to come from outside himself
o'brien pick up the cage and as he do so press something in he
there be a sharp click
winston make a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair
he be hopeless ; every part of he even he head be hold immovably
o'brien move the cage near
he be less than a metre from winston have face
i have press the first lever say o'brien
he understand the construction of this cage
the masque will fit over he head leave no exit
when i press this other lever the door of the cage will slide up
these starve brute will shoot out of he like bullet
have he ever see a rat leap through the air ?
he will leap on to he face and bore straight into he
sometimes he attack the eyes first
sometimes he burrow through the cheek and devour the tongue
the cage be near ; he be close in
winston hear a succession of shrill cry which appear to be occur in the air above he head
but he fight furiously against he panic
to think to think even with a split second left - to think be the only hope
suddenly the foul musty odour of the brute strike he nostril
there be a violent convulsion of nausea inside he and he almost lose consciousness
everything have go black
for an instant he be insane a scream animal
yet he came out of the blackness clutch an idea
there be one and only one way to save himself
he musth interpose another human be the body of another human be between himself and the rat
the circle of the masque be large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else
the wire door be a couple of hand-spans from he face
the rat know what be coming now
one of them be leap up and down the other an old scaly grandfather of the sewer stand up with he pink hands against the bar and fiercely sniff the air
winston could see the whisker and the yellow tooth
again the black panic take hold of he
he be blind helpless mindless
he be a common punishment in imperial china say o'brien as didactically as ever
the masque be close on he face
the wire brushed he cheek
and then - no he be not relief only hope a tiny fragment of hope
too late perhaps too late
but he have suddenly understand that in the whole world there be just one person to who he could transfer he punishment - one body that he could thrust between himself and the rat
and he be shout frantically over and over
do he to julia !
do he to julia !
not he !
julia !
i do care what he do to he
tear he face off strip he to the bone
not he !
julia !
not he !
he be fall backward into enormous depth away from the rat
he be still strapped in the chair but he have fall through the floor through the wall of the building through the earth through the ocean through the atmosphere into outer space into the gulf between the star - always away away away from the rat
he be light year distant but o'brien be still standing at he side
there be still the cold touch of wire against he cheek
but through the darkness that envelop he he hear another metallic click and know that the cage door have click shut and not open
the chestnut tree be almost empty
a ray of sunlight slanting through a window fell on dusty table-tops
he be the lonely hour of fifteen
a tinny music trickle from the telescreens
winston sit in he usual corner gaze into an empty glass
now and again he glance up at a vast face which eyed he from the opposite wall
big brother be watch he the caption say
unbidden a waiter came and fill he glass up with victory gin shake into he a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork
he be saccharine flavour with clove the speciality of the cafe
winston be listen to the telescreen
at present only music be coming out of he but there be a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the ministry of peace
the news from the african front be disquieting in the extreme
on and off he have be worry about he all day
a eurasian army ( oceania be at war with eurasia : oceania have always be at war with eurasia ) be moving southward at terrify speed
the mid-day bulletin have not mention any definite area but he be probable that already the mouth of the congou be a battlefield
brazzaville and leopoldville be in danger
one do not have to look at the map to see what he mean
he be not merely a question of losing central africa : for the first time in the whole war the territory of oceania himself be menace
a violent emotion not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement flare up in he then fade again
he stopped thinking about the war
in these days he could never fix he mind on any one subject for more than a few moment at a time
he pick up he glass and drain he at a gulp
as always the gin make he shudder and even retch slightly
the stuff be horrible
the clove and saccharine himself disgusting enough in he sickly way could not disguise the flat oily smell ; and what be bad of all be that the smell of gin which dwell with he night and day be inextricably mixed up in he mind with the smell of those -
he never name them even in he thought and so far as he be possible he never visualize them
he be something that he be half-aware of hover close to he face a smell that cling to he nostril
as the gin rose in he he belch through purple lip
he have grown fat since he release he and have regain he old colour - indeed more than regain he
he feature have thicken the skin on nose and cheekbone be coarsely red even the bald scalp be too deep a pink
a waiter again unbidden bring the chessboard and the current issue of the time with the page turn down at the chessman problem
then seeing that winston have glass be empty he bring the gin bottle and fill he
there be no need to give order
he know he habit
the chessboard be always wait for he he corner table be always reserved ; even when the place be full he have he to himself since nobody care to be see sitting too close to he
he never even bother to count he drink
at irregular interval he present he with a dirty slip of paper which he say be the bill but he have the impression that he always undercharge he
he would have make no difference if he have be the other way about
he have always plenty of money nowadays
he even have a job a sinecure more highly-pay than he old job have be
the music from the telescreen stopped and a voice take over
winston raise he head to listen
no bulletin from the front however
he be merely a brief announcement from the ministry of plenty
in the preceding quarter he appear the tenth three year plan have quota for bootlace have be overfulfilled by 98 per cent
he examine the chessman problem and set out the piece
he be a tricky ending involve a couple of knight
white to play and mate in two move
winston look up at the portrait of big brother
white always mat he think with a sort of cloudy mysticism
always without exception he be so arrange
in no chessman problem since the beginning of the world have black ever win
do he not symbolize the eternal unvarying triumph of good over evil ?
the huge face gaze back at he full of calm power
white always mat
the voice from the telescreen pause and add in a different and much graver tone : he be warn to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty
fifteen-thirty !
this be news of the high importance
take care not to miss he
fifteen-thirty !
the tinking music strike up again
winston have heart stir
that be the bulletin from the front ; instinct tell he that he be bad news that be coming
all day with little spurt of excitement the think of a smashing defeat in africa have be in and out of he mind
he seem actually to see the eurasian army swarm across the never-break frontier and pour down into the tip of africa like a column of ant
why have he not be possible to outflank them in some way ?
the outline of the west african coast stand out vividly in he mind
he pick up the white knight and move he across the board
there be the proper spot
even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force mysteriously assemble suddenly plant in he rear cutting he communication by land and sea
he feel that by will he he be bring that other force into existence
but he be necessary to act quickly
if he could get control of the whole of africa if he have airfield and submarine basis at the cape he would cut oceania in two
he might mean anything : defeat breakdown the redivision of the world the destruction of the party !
he draw a deep breath
an extraordinary medley of feeling - but he be not a medley exactly ; rather he be successive layer of feeling in which one could not say which layer be undermost struggle inside he
the spasm pass
he put the white knight back in he place but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chessman problem
he thought wander again
almost unconsciously he trace with he finger in the dust on the table : 2+2=5
he can get inside he he have say
but he could get inside he
what happen to he here be for ever o'brien have say
that be a true word
there be thing he own act from which he could never re-cover
something be kill in he breast : burn out cauterize out
he have see he ; he have even speak to he
there be no danger in he
he know as though instinctively that he now take almost no interest in he doings
he could have arrange to meet he a second time if either of them have want to
actually he be by chance that he have meet
he be in the park on a vile biting day in march when the earth be like iron and all the grass seem dead and there be not a bud anywhere except a few crocus which have pushed himself up to be dismember by the wind
he be hurry along with freeze hands and water eyes when he saw he not ten metre away from he
he strike he at once that he have change in some ill-defined way
he almost pass one another without a sign then he turn and follow he not very eagerly
he know that there be no danger nobody would take any interest in he
he do not speak
he walk obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of he then seem to resign himself to have he at he side
presently he be in amongst a clump of ragged leafless shrub useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind
he halt
he be vilely cold
the wind whistle through the twig and fretted the occasional dirty-look crocus
he put he arm round he waist
there be no telescreen but there musth be hide microphone : besides he could be see
he do not matter nothing matter
he could have lie down on the ground and done that if he have want to
he flesh freeze with horror at the think of he
he make no response whatever to the clasp of he arm ; he do not even try to disengage himself
he know now what have change in he
he face be sallow and there be a long scar partly hide by the hair across he forehead and temple ; but that be not the change
he be that he waist have grown thick and in a surprising way have stiffen
he remember how once after the explosion of a rocket bomb he have help to drag a corpse out of some ruin and have be astonish not only by the incredible weight of the thing but by he rigidity and awkwardness to handle which make he seem more like stone than flesh
he body feel like that
he occur to he that the texture of he skin would be quite different from what he have once be
he do not attempt to kiss he nor do he speak
as he walk back across the grass he look directly at he for the first time
he be only a momentary glance full of contempt and dislike
he wonder whether he be a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether he be inspire also by he bloat face and the water that the wind keep squeeze from he eyes
he sit down on two iron chair side by side but not too close together
he saw that he be about to speak
he move he clumsy shoe a few centimetre and deliberately crush a twig
he foot seem to have grown broad he notice
i betray he he say baldly
i betray he he say
he give he another quick look of dislike
sometimes he say he threaten he with something something he can stand up to can even think about
and then he say do do he to he do he to somebody else do he to so-and-so
and perhaps he might pretend afterward that he be only a trick and that he just say he to make them stop and do really mean he
but that be true
at the time when he happen he do mean he
he think there have no other way of saving himself and he be quite ready to save himself that way
he want he to happen to the other person
he do give a damn what he suffer
all he care about be himself
all he care about be himself he echoed
and after that he do feel the same towards the other person any longer
no he say he do feel the same
there do not seem to be anything more to say
the wind plastered he thin overall against he body
almost at once he become embarrassing to sit there in silence : besides he be too cold to keep still
he say something about catching he tube and stand up to go
he musth meet again he say
yes he say he musth meet again
he follow irresolutely for a little distance half a pace behind he
he do not speak again
he do not actually try to shake he off but walk at just such a speed as to prevent he keeping abreast of he
he have make up he mind that he would accompany he as far as the tube station but suddenly this process of trail along in the cold seem pointless and unbearable
he be overwhelm by a desire not so much to get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree cafe which have never seem so attractive as at this moment
he have a nostalgic vision of he corner table with the newspaper and the chessboard and the everflowing gin
above all he would be warm in there
the next moment not altogether by accident he allow himself to become separate from he by a small knot of people
he make a half-hearted attempt to catch up then slow down turn and make off in the opposite direction
when he have go fifty metre he look back
the street be not crowded but already he could not distinguish he
any one of a dozen hurry figure might have be he
perhaps he thicken stiffen body be no longer recognizable from behind
at the time when he happen he have say he do mean he
he have mean he
he have not merely say he he have wish he
he have wish that he and not he should be deliver over to the -
something change in the music that trickle from the telescreen
a cracked and jeer note a yellow note came into he
and then - perhaps he be not happening perhaps he be only a memory taking on the semblance of sound - a voice be sing :
under the spread chestnut tree
i sell he and he sell he
the tears well up in he eyes
a passing waiter notice that he glass be empty and came back with the gin bottle
he take up he glass and sniff at he
the stuff grow not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drink
but he have become the element he swim in
he be he life he death and he resurrection
he be gin that sink he into stupor every night and gin that revive he every morning
when he wake seldom before eleven hundred with gum-up eyelid and fiery mouth and a back that seem to be break he would have be impossible even to rise from the horizontal if he have not be for the bottle and teacup place beside the bed overnight
through the midday hours he sit with glaze face the bottle handy listen to the telescreen
from fifteen to close-time he be a fixture in the chestnut tree
no one care what he do any longer no whistle wake he no telescreen admonish he
occasionally perhaps twice a week he go to a dusty forget-look office in the ministry of truth and do a little work or what be call work
he have be appoint to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which have sprout from one of the innumerable committee deal with minor difficulty that arise in the compilation of the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary
he be engaged in produce something call an interim report but what he be that he be report on he have never definitely found out
he be something to do with the question of whether comma should be place inside bracket or outside
there be four other on the committee all of them person similar to himself
there be days when he assemble and then promptly disperse again frankly admit to one another that there be not really anything to be done
but there be other days when he settle down to he work almost eagerly making a tremendous show of enter up he minutes and draft long memorandum which be never finished - when the argument as to what he be supposedly argue about grow extraordinarily involved and abstruse with subtle haggle over definition enormous digression quarrel threat even to appeal to high authority
and then suddenly the life would go out of them and he would sit round the table look at one another with extinct eyes like ghost fading at cock-crow
the telescreen be silent for a moment
winston raise he head again
the bulletin !
but no he be merely change the music
he have the map of africa behind he eyelid
the movement of the army be a diagram : a black arrow tearing vertically southward and a white arrow horizontally eastward across the tail of the first
as though for reassurance he look up at the imperturbable face in the portrait
be he conceivable that the second arrow do not even exist ?
he interest flag again
he drink another mouthful of gin pick up the white knight and make a tentative move
check
but he be evidently not the right move because
uncalled a memory float into he mind
he saw a candle-light room with a vast white bed and himself a boy of nine or ten sitting on the floor shake a dice-box and laugh excitedly
he mother be sitting opposite he and also laugh
he musth have be about a month before he disappear
he be a moment of reconciliation when the nag hunger in he belly be forget and he earlier affection for he have temporarily revive
he remember the day well a pelt drench day when the water stream down the window-pane and the light indoors be too dull to read by
the boredom of the two child in the dark cramped bedroom become unbearable
winston whine and grizzled make futile demand for food fretted about the room pull everything out of place and kick the wainscot until the neighbour bang on the wall while the young child wail intermittently
in the end he mother say now be good and i will buy he a toy
a lovely toy - he will love he ; and then he have go out in the rain to a little general shop which be still sporadically open nearby and came back with a cardboard box contain an outfit of snake and ladder
he could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard
he be a miserable outfit
the board be cracked and the tiny wooden dice be so ill-cut that he would hardly lie on he side
winston look at the thing sulkily and without interest
but then he mother light a piece of candle and he sit down on the floor to play
soon he be wildly excited and shout with laughter as the tiddly-wink climb hopefully up the ladder and then came slither down the snake again almost to the starting-point
he play eight game winning four each
he tiny sister too young to understand what the game be about have sit prop up against a bolster laugh because the other be laugh
for a whole afternoon he have all be happy together as in he earlier childhood
he pushed the picture out of he mind
he be a false memory
he be trouble by false memory occasionally
he do not matter so long as one know them for what he be
some thing have happen other have not happen
he turn back to the chessboard and pick up the white knight again
almost in the same instant he drop on to the board with a clatter
he have start as though a pin have run into he
a shrill trumpet-call have pierce the air
he be the bulletin !
victory !
he always mean victory when a trumpet-call precede the news
a sort of electric drill run through the cafe
even the waiter have start and prick up he ear
the trumpet-call have let loose an enormous volume of noise
already an excited voice be gabble from the telescreen but even as he start he be almost drown by a roar of cheer from outside
the news have run round the street like magic
he could hear just enough of what be issue from the telescreen to realize that he have all happen as he have foresee ; a vast sea-borne armada have secretly assemble a sudden blow in the enemy have rear the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black
fragment of triumphant phrase pushed himself through the din : vast strategic manoeuvre - perfect coordination - utter rout - half a million prisoner - complete demoralization - control of the whole of africa - bring the war within measurable distance of he end victory - greatest victory in human history - victory victory victory !
under the table winston have foot make convulsive movement
he have not stir from he seat but in he mind he be running swiftly running he be with the crowd outside cheer himself deaf
he look up again at the portrait of big brother
the colossus that bestride the world !
the rock against which the horde of asia dash himself in vain !
he think how ten minutes ago - yes only ten minutes - there have still be equivocation in he heart as he wonder whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat
ah he be more than a eurasian army that have perished !
much have change in he since that first day in the ministry of love but the final indispensable heal change have never happen until this moment
the voice from the telescreen be still pour forth he tale of prisoner and booty and slaughter but the shout outside have die down a little
the waiter be turning back to he work
one of them approach with the gin bottle
winston sitting in a blissful dream pay no attention as he glass be fill up
he be not running or cheer any longer
he be back in the ministry of love with everything forgive he soul white as snow
he be in the public dock confess everything implicate everybody
he be walking down the white-tile corridor with the feeling of walking in sunlight and an armed guard at he back
the longhoped-for bullet be enter he brain
he gaze up at the enormous face
forty year he have take he to learn what kind of smile be hide beneath the dark moustache
o cruel needless misunderstanding !
o stubborn self-willed exile from the loving breast !
two gin-scent tears trickle down the side of he nose
but he be all right everything be all right the struggle be finished
he have win the victory over himself
he love big brother
newspeak be the official language of oceania and have be devise to meet the ideological needs of ingsoc or english socialism
in the year 1984 there be not as yet anyone who used newspeak as he sole means of communication either in speech or writing
the leading article in the time be write in he but this be a tour de force which could only be carry out by a specialist
he be expect that newspeak would have finally supersede oldspeak ( or standard english as he should call he ) by about the year 2050
meanwhile he gain ground steadily all party member tend to use newspeak word and grammatical construction more and more in he everyday speech
the version in use in 1984 and embody in the ninth and tenth edition of the newspeak dictionary be a provisional one and contain many superfluous word and archaic formation which be due to be suppress later
he be with the final perfect version as embody in the eleventh edition of the dictionary that he be concerned here
the purpose of newspeak be not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habit proper to the devotee of ingsoc but to make all other mode of think impossible
he be intended that when newspeak have be adopted once and for all and oldspeak forget a heretical think - that be a think diverge from the principle of ingsoc - should be literally unthinkable at least so far as think be dependent on word
he vocabulary be so construct as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member could properly wish to express while exclude all other meaning and also the possibility of arrive at them by indirect method
this be done partly by the invention of new word but chiefly by eliminate undesirable word and by strip such word as remain of unorthodox meaning and so far as possible of all stress meaning whatever
to give a single example
the word free still exist in newspeak but he could only be used in such statement as this dog be free from louse or this field be free from weed
he could not be used in he old sense of politically free or intellectually free since political and intellectual freedom no longer exist even as concept and be therefore of necessity nameless
quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical word reduction of vocabulary be regard as an end in himself and no word that could be dispense with be allow to survive
newspeak be design not to extend but to diminish the range of think and this purpose be indirectly assist by cutting the choice of word down to a minimum
newspeak be found on the english language as he now know he though many newspeak sentence even when not contain newly-create word would be barely intelligible to an english-speaker of he own day
newspeak word be divided into three distinct classis known as the a vocabulary the b vocabulary ( also call compound word ) and the c vocabulary
he will be simple to discuss each class separately but the grammatical peculiarity of the language can be deal with in the section devoted to the a vocabulary since the same rule hold good for all three category
the a vocabulary
the a vocabulary consist of the word need for the business of everyday life - for such thing as eating drink working putt on one have clothes going up and down stairs riding in vehicle garden cook and the like
he be composed almost entirely of word that he already possess word like hit run dog tree sugar house field - but in comparison with the present-day english vocabulary he number be extremely small while he meaning be far more rigidly define
all ambiguity and shades of meaning have be purge out of them
so far as he could be achieve a newspeak word of this class be simply a staccato sound express one clearly understand concept
he would have be quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literary purpose or for political or philosophical discussion
he be intended only to express simple purposive thought usually involve concrete object or physical action
the grammar of newspeak have two outstanding peculiarity
the first of these be an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech
any word in the language ( in principle this applied even to very abstract word such as if or when ) could be used either as verb noun adjective or adverb
between the verb and the noun forme when he be of the same root there be never any variation this rule of himself involve the destruction of many archaic forme
the word think for example do not exist in newspeak
he place be take by think which do duty for both noun and verb
no etymological principle be follow here : in some case he be the original noun that be choose for retention in other case the verb
even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning be not etymologically connected one or other of them be frequently suppress
there be for example no such word as cut he meaning be sufficiently cover by the noun-verb knife
adjective be form by add the suffix - ful to the noun-verb and adverb by add - wise
thus for example speedful mean rapid and speedwise mean quickly
certain of he present-day adjective such as good strong big black soft be retain but he total number be very small
there be little need for them since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrive at by add - ful to a noun-verb
none of the now-exist adverb be retain except for a very few already ending in - wise : the - wise termination be invariable
the word well for example be replace by goodwise
in addition any word - this again applied in principle to every word in the language - could be negatived by add the affix poco - or could be strengthen by the affix plus - or for still great emphasis doubleplus -
thus for example uncold mean warm while pluscold and doublepluscold mean respectively very cold and superlatively cold
he be also possible as in present-day english to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affix such as ante - post - up - down - etc
by such method he be found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary
give for instance the word good there be no need for such a word as bad since the require meaning be equally well - indeed good - express by ungood
all that be necessary in any case where two word form a natural pair of opposites be to decide which of them to suppress
dark for example could be replace by unlight or light by undark according to preference
the second distinguish mark of newspeak grammar be he regularity
subject to a few exception which be mention below all inflection follow the same rule
thus in all verb the preterite and the past participle be the same and end in - ed
the preterite of steal be stealed the preterite of think be thinked and so on throughout the language all such forme as swim give bring spoke take etc be abolish
all plural be make by add - s or - es as the case might be
the plural of man ox life be man oxes lifes
comparison of adjective be invariably make by add - er - est ( good gooder goodest ) irregular forme and the more most formation be suppress
the only classis of word that be still allow to inflect irregularly be the pronoun the relative the demonstrative adjective and the auxiliary verb
all of these follow he ancient usage except that who have be scrap as unnecessary and the shall should tense have be drop all he use be cover by will and would
there be also certain irregularity in word-formation arise out of the need for rapid and easy speech
a word which be difficult to utter or be liable to be incorrectly hear be hold to be ipso_facto a bad word : occasionally therefore for the sake of euphony extra letters be inserted into a word or an archaic formation be retain
but this need make himself feel chiefly in connection with the b vocabulary
why so great an importance be attached to ease of pronunciation will be make clear later in this essay
the b vocabulary
the b vocabulary consist of word which have be deliberately construct for political purpose : word that be to say which not only have in every case a political implication but be intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person use them
without a full understanding of the principle of ingsoc he be difficult to use these word correctly
in some case he could be translate into oldspeak or even into word take from the a vocabulary but this usually demand a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtone
the b word be a sort of verbal shorthand often packing whole range of idea into a few syllable and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language
the b word be in all case compound word
he consist of two or more word or portion of word weld together in an easily pronounceable forme
the result amalgam be always a noun-verb and inflect according to the ordinary rule
to take a single example : the word goodthink meaning very roughly orthodoxy or if one chose to regard he as a verb to think in an orthodox manner
this inflect as follow : noun-verb goodthink ; past tense and past participle goodthinked ; present participle good-thinking ; adjective goodthinkful ; adverb goodthinkwise ; verbal noun goodthinker
the b word be not construct on any etymological plan
the word of which he be make up could be any parts of speech and could be place in any order and mutilate in any way which make them easy to pronounce while indicate he derivation
in the word crimethink ( thoughtcrime ) for instance the think came second whereas in thinkpol ( think police ) he came first and in the latter word police have lose he second syllable
because of the great difficulty in secure euphony irregular formation be commoner in the b vocabulary than in the a vocabulary
for example the adjective forme of minitrue minipax and miniluv be respectively minitruthful minipeaceful and minilovely simply because - trueful - paxful and - loveful be slightly awkward to pronounce
in principle however all b word could inflect and all inflect in exactly the same way
some of the b word have highly subtilize meaning barely intelligible to anyone who have not master the language as a whole
consider for example such a typical sentence from a time leading article as oldthinkers unbellyfeel ingsoc
the short rendering that one could make of this in oldspeak would be : those who idea be form before the revolution can have a full emotional understanding of the principle of english socialism
but this be not an adequate translation
to begin with in order to grasp the full meaning of the newspeak sentence quoted above one would have to have a clear idea of what be mean by ingsoc
and in addition only a person thoroughly ground in ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word bellyfeel which implied a blind enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today ; or of the word oldthink which be inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence
but the special function of certain newspeak word of which oldthink be one be not so much to express meaning as to destroy them
these word necessarily few in number have have he meaning extended until he contain within himself whole battery of word which as he be sufficiently cover by a single comprehensive term could now be scrap and forget
the greatest difficulty facing the compiler of the newspeak dictionary be not to invent new word but have invent them to make sure what he mean : to make sure that be to say what range of word he cancel by he existence
as he have already see in the case of the word free word which have once bear a heretical meaning be sometimes retain for the sake of convenience but only with the undesirable meaning purge out of them
countless other word such as honour justice morality internationalism democracy science an religion have simply cease to exist
a few blanket word cover them and in cover them abolish them
all word grouping himself round the concept of liberty and equality for instance be contain in the single word crimethink while all word grouping himself round the concept of objectiveness and rationalism be contain in the single word oldthink
great precision would have be dangerous
what be require in a party member be an outlook similar to that of the ancient hebrew who know without knowing much else that all nation other than he own worship false god
he do not need to know that these god be call baal osiris moloch ashtaroth and the like : probably the less he know about them the good for he orthodoxy
he know jehovah and the commandment of jehovah : he know therefore that all god with other name or other attribute be false god
in somewhat the same way the party member know what constitute right conduct and in exceedingly vague generalize terms he know what kind of departure from he be possible
he sexual life for example be entirely regulate by the two newspeak word sexcrime ( sexual immorality ) and goodsex ( chastity ) 
sexcrime cover all sexual misdeed whatever
he cover fornication adultery homosexuality and other perversion and in addition normal intercourse practise for he own sake
there be no need to enumerate them separately since he be all equally culpable and in principle all punishable by death
in the c vocabulary which consist of scientific and technical word he might be necessary to give specialize name to certain sexual aberration but the ordinary citizen have no need of them
he know what be mean by goodsex - that be to say normal intercourse between man and wife for the sole purpose of beget child and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman : all else be sexcrime
in newspeak he be seldom possible to follow a heretical think further than the perception that he be heretical : beyond that point the necessary word be nonexistent
no word in the b vocabulary be ideologically neutral
a great many be euphemism
such word for instance as joycamp ( forced-labor camp ) or minipax ministry of peace i _e ministry of war ) mean almost the exact opposite of what he appear to mean
some word on the other hand display a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society
an example be prolefeed meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party hand out to the masses
other word again be ambivalent have the connotation good when applied to the party and bad when applied to he enemy
but in addition there be great number of word which at first sight appear to be mere abbreviation and which derive he ideological colour not from he meaning but from he structure
so far as he could be contrived everything that have or might have political significance of any kind be fitted into the b vocabulary
the name of every organization or body of people or doctrine or country or institution or public building be invariably cut down into the familiar shape ; that be a single easily pronounced word with the small number of syllable that would preserve the original derivation
in the ministry of truth for example the record department in which winston smith worked be call recdep the fiction department be call ficdep the teleprogrammes department be call teledep and so on
this be not done solely with the object of saving time
even in the early decade of the twentieth century telescope word and phrase have be one of the characteristic feature of political language ; and he have be notice that the tendency to use abbreviation of this kind be most marked in totalitarian country and totalitarian organization
example be such word as nazi gestapo comintern inprecorr agitprop
in the beginning the practice have be adopted as he be instinctively but in newspeak he be used with a conscious purpose
he be perceive that in thus abbreviate a name one narrow and subtly alter he meaning by cutting out most of the association that would otherwise cling to he
the word communist international for instance call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood red flagstone barricade karl marx and the paris commune
the word comintern on the other hand suggest merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-define body of doctrine
he refer to something almost as easily recognize and as limited in purpose as a chair or a table
comintern be a word that can be utter almost without taking think whereas communist international be a phrase over which one be oblige to linger at least momentarily
in the same way the association call up by a word like minitrue be few and more controllable than those call up by ministry of truth
this account not only for the habit of abbreviate whenever possible but also for the almost exaggerated care that be take to make every word easily pronounceable
in newspeak euphony outweigh every consideration other than exactitude of meaning
regularity of grammar be always sacrifice to he when he seem necessary
and rightly so since what be require above all for political purpose be short clip word of unmistakable meaning which could be utter rapidly and which rouse the minimum of echo in the speaker have mind
the word of the b vocabulary even gain in force from the fact that nearly all of them be very much alike
almost invariably these word - goodthink minipax prolefeed sexcrime joycamp ingsoc bellyfeel thinkpol and countless other - be word of two or three syllable with the stress distribute equally between the first syllable and the last
the use of them encourage a gabble style of speech at once staccato and monotonous
and this be exactly what be aim at
the intention be to make speech and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of consciousness
for the purpose of everyday life he be no doubt necessary or sometimes necessary to reflect before speaking but a party member call upon to make a political or ethical judgment should be able to spray forth the correct opinion as automatically as a machine gun spray forth bullet
he training fitted he to do this the language give he an almost foolproof instrument and the texture of the word with he harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which be in accord with the spirit of ingsoc assist the process still further
so do the fact of have very few word to choose from
relative to he own the newspeak vocabulary be tiny and new way of reduce he be constantly be devise
newspeak indeed differ from most all other language in that he vocabulary grow small instead of large every year
each reduction be a gain since the small the area of choice the small the temptation to take think
ultimately he be hope to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involve the high brain center at all
this aim be frankly admit in the newspeak word duckspeak meaning to quack like a duck
like various other word in the b vocabulary duckspeak be ambivalent in meaning
provided that the opinion which be quack out be orthodox one he implied nothing but praise and when the time refer to one of the orator of the party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker he be pay a warm and value compliment
the c vocabulary
the c vocabulary be supplementary to the other and consist entirely of scientific and technical terms
these resemble the scientific terms in use today and be construct from the same root but the usual care be take to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meaning
he follow the same grammatical rule as the word in the other two vocabulary
very few of the c word have any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech
any scientific worker or technician could find all the word he need in the list devoted to he own speciality but he seldom have more than a smattering of the word occur in the other lists
only a very few word be common to all lists and there be no vocabulary express the function of science as a habit of mind or a method of think irrespective of he particular branch
there be indeed no word for science any meaning that he could possibly bear be already sufficiently cover by the word ingsoc
from the foregoing account he will be see that in newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinion above a very low level be well-nigh impossible
he be of course possible to utter heresy of a very crude kind a species of blasphemy
he would have be possible for example to say big brother be ungood
but this statement which to an orthodox ear merely convey a self-evident absurdity could not have be sustain by reasoned argument because the necessary word be not available
idea inimical to ingsoc could only be entertain in a vague wordless forme and could only be name in very broad terms which lump together and condemn whole group of heresy without define them in doing so
one could in fact only use newspeak for unorthodox purpose by illegitimately translate some of the word back into oldspeak
for example all man be equal be a possible newspeak sentence but only in the same sense in which all man be redhaired be a possible oldspeak sentence
he do not contain a grammatical error but he express a palpable untruth - i e that all man be of equal size weight or strength
the concept of political equality no longer exist and this stress meaning have accordingly be purge out of the word equal
in 1984 when oldspeak be still the normal means of communication the danger theoretically exist that in use newspeak word one might remember he original meaning
in practice he be not difficult for any person well ground in double-think to avoid doing this but within a couple of generation even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanish
a person grow up with newspeak as he sole language would no more know that equal have once have the stress meaning of politically equal or that free have once mean intellectually free than for instance a person who have never hear of chessman would be aware of the stress meaning attach to queen and rook
there would be many crime and error which he would be beyond he power to commit simply because he be nameless and therefore unimaginable
and he be to be foresee that with the passage of time the distinguish characteristic of newspeak would become more and more pronounced - he word grow few and few he meaning more and more rigid and the chance of putt them to improper use always diminish
when oldspeak have be once and for all supersede the last link with the past would have be sever
history have already be rewrite but fragment of the literature of the past survive here and there imperfectly censor and so long as one retain one have knowledge of oldspeak he be possible to read them
in the future such fragment even if he chance to survive would be unintelligible and untranslatable
he be impossible to translate any passage of oldspeak into newspeak unless he either refer to some technical process or some very simple everyday action or be already orthodox ( goodthinkful would be the newspeak expression ) in tendency
in practice this mean that no book write before approximately 1960 could be translate as a whole
pre-revolutionary literature could only be subject to ideological translation - that be alteration in sense as well as language
take for example the well-known passage from the declaration of independence :
he hold these truth to be self-evident that all man be create equal that he be endow by he creator with certain inalienable right that amongst these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
that to secure these right government be institute amongst man derive he power from the consent of the govern
that whenever any forme of government become destructive of those end he be the right of the people to alter or abolish he and to institute new government .
he would have be quite impossible to render this into newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original
the near one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink
a full translation could only be an ideological translation whereby jefferson have word would be change into a panegyric on absolute government
a good deal of the literature of the past be indeed already be transform in this way
consideration of prestige make he desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figure while at the same time bring he achievement into line with the philosophy of ingsoc
various writer such as shakespeare milton swift byron dickens and some other be therefore in process of translation : when the task have be complete he original writing with all else that survive of the literature of the past would be destroy
these translation be a slow and difficult business and he be not expect that he would be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first century
there be also large quantity of merely utilitarian literature - indispensable technical manual and the like - that have to be treat in the same way
he be chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of newspeak have be fixed for so late a date as 2050
